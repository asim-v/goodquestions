#101 – Joscha Bach: Artificial Consciousness and the Nature of Reality, The following is a conversation with Joscha Bach, VP of research at the AI Foundation, with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard. Joscha is one of the most unique and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community exploring the workings of the human mind, intelligence, consciousness, life on Earth and the possibly simulated fabric of our universe. I can see myself talking to Joscha many times in the future.

As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany, just as we were talking about OFF-MIKE to parents who are artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the most unique thinkers in the world. So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit? What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies or just realizations that impact on you when you were growing up that kind of led to the trajectory or were the key sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development? My father came from a long tradition of architects, distant branch of the family, and so basically he was technically inert and not need to interface in society with non-standard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And, um, no more people understand that the primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict, which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large. Who is the reviewer? In the nerds view of communication, everybody who you consider to be a peer, so whatever hapless individual is around, well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information. OK, so you're not by the way, my research for male informed me. So you're. Architect, architecture, artist, study architecture, but, um, basically my grandfather made the wrong decision, he married an aristocrat and was drawn into into the war and he came back after 15 years. So basically, my father was not, um, parented by inert by, but by somebody who tried to tell him what to do and expected him to do what he was told and he was unable to or is unable to do things if he's not intrinsically motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son and her son responded. By then he became an architect to become an artist. So he built Hundertwasser architecture. He built houses without right angles. Be lots of things that didn't work in the more bootless traditions of eastern Germany. And so he bought an old watermill and moved out of the countryside and did only what he wanted to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for him because you had complete material safety. You put was heavily subsidized. Health care was free. You didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything. So as a socialist communist side of this and the other things, it was almost impossible not to be in political disagreement with your government, which is very productive for artists. So everything that you do is intrinsically meaningful because it will always touch on the deeper currents of society of culture and be in conflict with that and tension visit. And you will always have to define yourself with respect to this. So what impact did your father this outside the outside of the box thinker against the government, against the world artists? Have you was not a thinker. You were somebody who only got half of it to the degree that he needed to make himself functional. So in some senses, it was also in the late 1960s and he was in some sense a hippie. So he became a one person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. You build big sculpture gardens and started many avenues of art and so on and convinced a woman to live with them. She was also an architect and she adored him and decided to share her life with him. And I basically grew up in a big cave full of books. I'm almost feral and I was bored out there. It was very, very beautiful, very quiet and quite lonely. So I started to read and by the time I came to school, I read everything until the fourth grade and then some. And there was not a real way for me to relate to the outside world. And I couldn't quite put my finger on why. And today I know it was because I was nerd, obviously, and it was the only nerd around. So there was no other kids like me and there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on. And this village school that I went to was a nice school. Kids were nice to me. I was not beaten up. But I also didn't make many friends or built deep relationships. They only happened and starting from ninth grade when I went to a school for mathematics and physics. Do you remember any key books from myself? I think I read everything. So I went to the library and I worked my way through the children's and young adult sections and then I read a lot of science fiction. For instance, Stanislav Leme, basically the great author of cybernetics, has influenced me back then. I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote seemed to be so natural to me. It's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote. Another thing that was very influential on me, the classical philosophers and also the teacher of romanticism. So German poetry and art and trustor, Hulshof and Haina and up to Hesser and so on as a love has her. So at which point is the classical philosophers? And at this point or in the 21st century, what's what's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch through even as far as Nietzsche or is this are we talking about Plato and Aristotle? And I think that nature is the classical equivalent of a set poster. So there is classical Trotsky to read and yeah, but he's not so much taller. Others, he's trotting himself because he was at odds with the world. Largely his romantic relationships didn't work out. He got angry and he basically became a nihilist. And that is that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual is to constantly be trying yourself to be in that conflict, in that no attention, lack of self-awareness. At some point, you have to understand the comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not functional, it ends in tragedy, as it did for nature. I think you think he took himself too seriously and that in that tension and it's the same thing in Hesser and so on, this Steppenwolf's syndrome is classic adolescence where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self awareness, because you think that you are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them based on. Innate instincts, and it doesn't work out and you become a transcendentalist to deal with that. So it's very, very understandable and have great sympathy for this to the degree that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history. But what if it was an intellectual, a life well lived, a journey while child is one where you don't take yourself seriously from? I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself because you need to become unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher, belief is not a verb. Now, you don't do this for the audience and you don't do it for yourself. You have to submit to the things that are possibly true and you have to follow wherever you are rereleased. But it's not about you. It has nothing to do with you. Do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of an idea of objective truth? So what's your sense in the philosophical? If you remove yourself as objective from the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover ideas that are true? Or are we just in a matter of relative concepts that are either true or false? It's just a giant mess. You cannot define objective truth without understanding the nature of truths in the first place. Or what does the brain mean by saying that? Discover something as truth. So, for instance, a model can be predictive or not predictive, then that can be a sense in which a mathematical statement can be true because it's defined as true under certain conditions. So it's basically a particular state that a variable can have an assembled game and then you can have a correspondence between systems and talk about truths, which is again a type of model correspondence, and that also seems to be a particular kind of ground. So, for instance, you're confronted with the enormity of something existing at all. Right, that's stunning when you realize something exists rather than nothing. And this seems to be all right. There is an absolute truth in the fact that something seems to be happening. Yeah, that's that to me is a showstopper. I can just think about that idea and be amazed by that idea for the rest of my life and not go any farther because I don't even know the answer to that. Why does anything exist at all? Well, the easiest answer is existence is the default rate. So this is the lowest number of bits that you would need to encode. This was the answer to the simplest answer is that existence is the default. What about non-existence? I mean, there seems non-existence might not be a meaningful notion in the sense or in some sense, if everything that can exist exists for something to exist, it probably needs to be implementable. The only thing that can be implemented is finite automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the superposition of all finite automata. And we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties that it can contain us. What does it mean to be a superposition of another swinish superposition of all, like all possible rules? Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator that acts on some substrate and as a result you get emergent patterns, most of substrate, um, no idea to know. So some substrate, it's some sort of something that can store information, something they can store information. There's something that can hold state still. Does it make sense to me the why that exists at all? I could just sit there with a with a beer or or a vodka and just enjoy the fact pondering the why may not have a why this might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there could be no relation in the right direction without asking for a purpose or cause. It doesn't mean that everything has to have a purpose or cause. Right. So we mentioned some philosophers in that early, just taking a brief step back into into that. So we asked ourselves, when did classical philosophy end? I think what Germany largely ended was the first revolution that's basically even which was that this was when the end of the monarchy and started a democracy. And at this point, B basically came up with a new form of government that didn't have a good sense of the new organism. That society wanted to be an innovator, decapitator, the universities. So the universities went on to modernism like a headless chicken. At the same time, democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism as a result. Yeah, and it burned down things in a similar way as Stalinism burnt down intellectual traditions in Russia and Germany. Both Germanys have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had this vulgar dialectic materialism and western Germany didn't get much more edgy than Habermas. So in some sense, both countries lost their intellectual traditions and killing off and driving out the Jews didn't help. Yes, that was the end. That was the end of really rigorous thought. What you say is classical classical philosophy. There's also this thing that in some sense, the low hanging fruit and philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered was the constructivist turn in mathematics. So to. And that the parts of mathematics that work are a computation. There was a very significant discovery in the first half of the 20th century and it hasn't fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists checked out the, quote, libraries for mathematics before constructivism became universal. What constructivism what are you referring to? Girls and completeness theorem, that kind of those kinds of ideas. The girl himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Foubert saw that, for instance, countries said 080 experiments in mathematics led into contradictions. And he noticed that the current semantics you cannot build a computer in mathematics that runs mathematics without crashing and good proof could prove this. And so what Google could show is using classical mathematical semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Google strongly believed in these semantics and then in what you could observe and so on, he was shocked. It basically shook his world to the core because in some sense, he felt that the world has to be implemented in classical mathematics. Yes. And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that you could see that the solution is to understand that mathematics was computation all along, which means you, for instance, PI in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a function, but it's the same thing in computation, a function is only a value when you can compute it, and if you cannot compute the last digit of PI, you only have a function. You can plug this function into your local sun, let it run until the sun burns out. This is it. This is the last digit of pi, you will know. But it also means there can be no process in the physical universe or in any physically realized computer. That depends on having known the last mission of PI. Yes, which means there are parts of physics that are defined in such a way that cannot strictly be taught because assuming that this could be true into contradictions. So I think putting computation at the center of the world view is actually the right way to think about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it and Wittgenstein basically preempted the logic largest program of that. Minsky started later. Like 30 years later, Turing was actually a pupil of Wittgenstein. And I didn't know there's any connection between it and don't even canceled some classes. Venturing was not present because he thought it was not worth spending the time. That's interesting. If you read the Tractatus, it's a very beautiful book by capacity one thought on 75 pages, very non-tropical for philosophy because it doesn't have arguments in it and it doesn't have references. And it's just one thought that there's not intending to convince anybody who says it's mostly for people that had the same insight as me. Just spell it out. And this insight is there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy ought to meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those that are so formal that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make. But the price that you pay is that your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say something meaningful in mathematics. Yes, and it looks complicated to people, but it's far less complicated than what our brain is casually doing all the time. Makes sense of reality. That's right. And philosophy is coming from the top. So it's mostly starting from natural languages with a vaguely defined concepts. And the hope is that mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point. And Wittgenstein was trying to make that meet and he already understood that, for instance, you could express everything was the calculus that you could produce the entire logic to NAND gates, as we do in our modern computers. So in some sense, you already understood Turing Universality before Turing spelled it out? I think when he wrote the Tractatus, he didn't understand yet that the idea was so important and significant. And I suspect then when Turing wrote it out, nobody cared that much you're doing was not that famous when you lived. It was mostly his work and decrypting the German codes that made him famous or gave him some notoriety. But this same status that he has to computer science right now. Yeah, something that I think he could acquire later. That's kind of interesting. Do you think of computation and computer science and you kind of represent that to me? Maybe that's the modern day. You, in a sense, are the new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist who dares to ask the bigger questions. That philosophy originally started is the new philosophy. Is the new philosopher certainly not me. I think I mostly build this child that grows up in a very beautiful valley and looks at the world from the outside and tries to understand what's going on. And my teachers tell me things and they largely don't make sense. Right? So I have to make my own models. I have to discover the foundations of what the others are saying. I have to try to fix them to be charitable. I try to understand what they must have thought originally or what their teachers or their teachers teachers must have thought until everything got lost in translation and how to make sense of the reality that we are in. And whenever I have an original idea, I'm usually late to the party by, say, 400 years. And the only thing that's good is that the parties get smaller and smaller. The older I get in, the more I explore the party. The parties get smaller and more exclusive and more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing was that you were not tethered. Whether it's because your parents or in general, maybe you're something within your within your mind, some genetic material. They were not tethered to the ideas of the general populace, which is actually a unique property. We're kind of, you know, the education system and whatever from the education system just existing in this world forces a certain set of ideas that you can you disentangle that? Why were you why are you not so tethered even in your work today? You seem to not care about perhaps a best paper in Europe's right. Being tethered to particular things that current today. In this year, people seem to value as a thing. You put on your CV and resume. You're a little bit more outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people especially focus on the benchmarks of today, the things what can you disentangle that? Because I think that's inspiring. And if there were more people like that, we might be able to solve some of the bigger problems that sort of I. Dreams to solve, and that's a big danger in this, because in a way, you are expected to marry into an intellectual tradition and within this tradition into a particular school. If everybody comes up with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not cumulative as an enterprise. Right. So in some sense, you need a healthy balance. You need paradigmatic thinkers and you need people that work within given paradigms. Basically sciences today to find themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a disease that we think as a scientist, somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor that they should join a particular discipline and then they find a good mentor to learn the right methods and then they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team. And then their name will show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns with this approach. And when our field computer science they started, most of the people that joined this field had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers and I either don't have interesting opinions at all or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually doing, because what they're doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon. And this is often a good idea if if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for me, it's, first of all, very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it right? If if the current methods of measuring learning lead to strong A.I., why should I be doing it right? I guess just wait until they're done and wait until they do this on the beach or read interesting books or write them and have fun. But if you don't think that you're currently doing the right thing, if you are missing some perspectives, then it's required to think outside of the box. It's also required to understand the boxes. But it's it's necessary to understand what worked and what didn't work and for what reasons. So you have to be willing to ask new questions and design new methods whenever you want to answer them. And you have to be willing to dismiss the existing methods if you think that they're not going to yield the right answers. It's very bad career advice to do that. So maybe to briefly stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say if you was the dream before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started? When was the dream to understand or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you? I think that you can see I largely today is, um, advanced information processing, if you will, change the acronym of A.I. into that. Most people in the field would be happy. It would not change anything. What they're doing by automating statistics and many of the statistical models are more advanced than what statisticians had in the past. And it's pretty good work. It's very productive. And the the other aspect of A is philosophical project. And this philosophical project is very risky. And very few people work on it and it's not clear if it succeeds. So first of all, you keep throwing sort of a lot of really interesting ideas. And I have to pick which ones we go with. But sort of first of all, you use the term information processing. Just information processing, as if it's it's the mere it's the muck of existence, as if it's the epitome of that, that the entirety of the universe may be information processes, that consciousness and intelligence be information so that maybe you can comment on if that's if the advanced information processing is is a limiting kind of realm of ideas. And then the other one is, what do you mean by the philosophical project? So I suspect that general intelligence is the result of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model. It's not necessarily goal directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this, but it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those patterns and be able to predict the next set of patterns to make sense of things. And some problems are a very general, usually intelligence service control. So you make these models for a particular purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results. But it's the intelligence itself is, in the sense instrumental to something. But by itself, it's just the ability to make models. And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes them needs to understand what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child, for instance, you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting different things. So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you have a complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself to reverse engineer yourself, to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself in relationship to your environment and this process. If this project if you reverse engineer yourself and your relationship to reality and the nature of a universe that can continue if you go all the way. This is basically the project of A.I. or you could say the project of AI is a very important component in it. That you Turing test in a way, is you ask a system what is intelligence? If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works, then you should sign it. The property of being intelligent in this general sense or the test that you're doing was administering in a way I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't express it yet. And the original 1950 paper, it's that he was trying to find out whether he was generally intelligent, because in order to take this test, the rap is, of course, you need to be able to understand what that system is saying. And we don't yet know if we can build on it. We don't yet know if we are generally intelligent. Basically, you win the Turing test by building an AI. Yes. So so in a sense, hidden within the Turing test is a kind of recursive test. Yes, it's a test on us. The Turing test is basically a test of the conjecture whether people are intelligent enough to understand themselves. OK, but you also mentioned a little bit of a self-awareness and then the project. Why do you think this kind of emergent self-awareness is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence? So as opposed to goal oriented, is this a kind of puzzle solving as coming to grips with the idea that you're an agent in the world and the find that many highly intelligent people are not very self-aware? Right. So self-awareness and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be self aware if you have, what, priors, especially without being especially intelligent. So you don't need to be very good at solving puzzles if the system that you are already implements the solution. But I do find intelligence. So you kind of mentioned children, right? It is that the fundamental project of A.I. is to create the learning system that's able to exist in the world. So you kind of draw a difference in self-awareness and intelligence. And yet you said that the self-awareness seems to be important for children. So I call this ability to make sense of the world and your own place in it all to make you able to understand what you are doing in this world, sentience and what distinguishes Danton's from intelligence, because sentience is possessing certain classes of models and intelligence is the way to get to these models if you don't already have them. I see. So can you can you maybe pause a bit and try to. Answered the question that we just said we may not be able to answer and it might be a recursive meta question of what is intelligence? And I think that intelligence is the ability to make models for models. I think it's useful as examples, very popular. Now, neural networks form representations. Of. Large scale data set, they they form models, although the results when you say models and look at today's neural networks, what are the difference of how you're thinking about what is intelligent in saying that intelligence is the process of making models to aspects to to this question? One is the representation, is the representation adequate for the domain that we want to represent. And the other one is, is the type of the model that you arrive at adequate. So basically, are you modeling the correct domain? And I think in both of these cases, what is lacking still? And I think that I'm not saying anything new. We are not criticizing the field. Most of the people that design our paradigms are aware of that. And so one aspect that we are missing is unified learning. When we learn, we at some point discover that everything that we sense is part of the same object, which means we learn it all into one model and we call this model the universe. So our experience of the world that we are embedded on is not a secret. Direct Vyatta, physical reality. Physical reality is if you are quantum graph that we can never experience or get access to, but it has the properties that it can create certain patterns that our systemic interface to the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship between the patterns that we discover is what we call the physical universe. So at some point in our development as a nervous system, we discover that everything that we relate to and in the world can be mapped to a region in the same three dimensional space. By and large, we now know in physics that this is not quite true. Well, there's not actually Three-Dimensional. But the world that we are entangled with at a level which we are entangled with is largely a flat, three dimensional space. And so this is the model that our brain is intuitively making. And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition of extensor, of this material about this material domain. It's one of the mental domains, but it's just the class of all models that relate to the environment is three dimensional physics engine in which we are embedded physics engine which were embedded. I love that it just slowly pours. So the quantum graph, I think you call that, which is the real world which you can never get access to. There's a bunch of questions I want to sort of disentangle that, but maybe one useful one, one of your recent talks I looked at. Can you just describe the basics? Can you talk about what is dualism or does idealism or is materialism? What is functionalism and what connects with you most in terms of because you just mentioned there's a reality we don't have access to. OK, what does that even mean? And why don't we get access to it and be part of that reality? Why don't we why can we access it? So the particular trajectory that mostly exists in the West is the result of our indoctrination by a card for 2000 years, which is also the Catholic class mostly. Yes. And for better or worse, it has created or defined many of the modes of interaction that we have that have created this society. But it has also, in some sense. Scart our irrationality and the intuition that exists, if you would translate the mythology of the Catholic Church into the modern world, is that the world in which you and me interact is something like a multiplayer role playing adventure. Yes. And the money and the objects that we have in this world, this is all not real. Or as esteemed philosophers would say, it's my it's just stuff that is supposed to be meaningful. And this embedding in this meaning, if you believe in it, it's samsara. It's basically the identification with the needs of the mundane, secular, everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced the notion of higher meaning, the sacred. And this existed before. But eventually the natural shape of God is the platonic form of the civilization that you're a part of. It's basically the super organism that is formed by the individuals as an international agent. And basically the Catholics used a relatively crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and get the software synchronized to make them walk lockstep. You get to get this got online and to make it efficient and effective. And I think God technically is just a self that spends multiple brains as opposed to your own myself, which mostly exists just on one brain. Right. And so in some sense, you can construct a self functionally as a function as implemented by brains that exists across brains. And this is a God with a small G. That's one of the few Yuval Harari kind of talking about is this is one of the nice features of our brains, it seems to that we can all download the same piece of software we got in this case and kind of share it. You give everybody a speck and the mathematical constraints that are intrinsic to information processing make sure that given the same spec, you come up with a compatible structure. OK, so that's there's a space of ideas that we all share and we think that's kind of the mind. But that's separate from the idea is from from Christianity, for from religion is that there's a separate thing between the mind as a real world. And the real world is the world in which God exists. God is the quarter of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game. And that's dualism, you say. But the fact is, because the mental realm is exists and the different implementation than the physical and the mental realm is real. And a lot of people have this intuition that there's this real room in which you and me talk and speak right now. Then comes a layer of physics and abstract rules and so on. And then comes another real room where our souls are. And our tool form isn't a thing that gives us phenomenal experience. And there's, of course, a very confused notion that you would get and it's basically it's the result of connecting materialism and idealism in the wrong way. So, OK, I apologize, but I think it's really helpful if we just try to define tried to define terms like what is dualism, what does idealism, what is materialism for people, Donna? So the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances, a mental substance and a physical substance, and they interact by different rules. And the physical world is basically causally closed and is built on a low level causal structure. So the bottom level that is causally closed, that's entirely mechanical and mechanical in the widest sense. So it's computational. It's basically a physical world in which information flows around and physics describes the laws of how information flows around. And which would you compare it to? Like a computer or you have a hardware and software. The computer is a generalization of information flowing around, basically, but you won't discover that is the universal principle. You can define this universal machine that is able to perform all the computations so all these machines have the same power. This means that you can always define a translation between them as long as they have unlimited memory, um, to be able to perform each other's computations. So would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware and idealism is this whole world is just a software? Uh, not quite. I think that most idealists don't have a notion of software yet because software also comes down to information processing. Right. So what you notice is the only thing that is real to you and me is this experiential world in which things matter, in which things have taste and which things of color, phenomenal content and so on. And we are bringing up consciousness, OK? And this is distinct from the physical world in which things have values in only in an abstract sense, and you only look at court patterns moving around. So how does anything feel like something in this connection between the two things is very puzzling to a lot of people and of course, too many philosophers. So idealism starts out with the notion that minder's primary materialism. Things that matter as primary and so for the idealist, the material patterns that we see playing playing out are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming and exist in the mind on a higher plane of existence if you want. And for the materialist, there is only this material thing and that generates some models. And we are the result of these models. And in some sense, I don't think that we should understand. If you understand it properly, materialism and idealism is a dichotomy. But as to different aspects of the same thing. So the weird thing is we don't exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story that the brain tells itself. OK, let me get my information processing I take to take that in. We don't exist in the physical world. We exist in the narrative. Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. New York cannot feel anything. They're physical things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything. But it would be very useful for the brain or for the organism to know what it would be like to be a person and to feel something. Yeah. So the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the interactions of the person. It's the best model of what that brain, this organism thinks it is in relationship to its environment. So it creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain is continuously writing and updating. But you also kind of said that you said that we kind of exist in that and say, yes, that story what is real in any of this. So, like, there's, again, these terms are you kind of said there's a quantum graph. I mean, what is what is this whole thing running on then is the story? And is it completely, fundamentally impossible to get access to it? Because isn't the story supposed to is in the brain in a in in something in existing in some kind of context? So what we can identify as computer scientists, we can engineer systems and test our theories this way that may have the necessary and sufficient properties to produce the phenomena that we're observing, which is there is the self in a virtual world that is generated in somebody's neocortex, that is contained in the skull of this primate here. And by that point at this indexical, it is, of course, wrong. But I do create something that is likely to give rise to patterns on your retina that allow you to interpret what I'm saying. Right. But we both know that the world that you and me are seeing is not the real physical world, but we are seeing is a virtual reality generated in your brain to explain the patterns on your retina are closest to the real world. That's kind of the question. Is that. When you have when you have like people like Donna Hoffman, as say that, like that, you're really far away. The thing we're seeing, you and I now, that interface we have is very far away from anything. Like we don't even have anything close, like to the sense of what the real world is or is it a very surface piece of architecture. Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal, right? This famous thing that one man would discover if you're a you see an overall shape in there. Right. But, you know, if you truly understand it, you know, it's two lines of code. It's basically in a serious that is being tested for complex numbers in a complex number, plain for every point. And for those where the series is diverging, you paint this black and it's converging. You don't and you get the intermediate colors by taking how fast it diverges. Yes, this gives you this shape of this fractal. But imagine you live inside of this fractal and you don't have access to where you are in the fractal or you have not discovered the generator function even. Right. So what you see is all I can see right now is the spiral and the spiral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate model of reality? Yes, it is. Right. It is an adequate description is, you know, that there is actually no spiral in the middle. But frankly, it only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting things as a two dimensional space and then to find certain regularities in there at a certain scale that are currently observed, because if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear, turn out to be something different at a different resolution, right? Yes. So at this level, you have the spiral and then you discover the spiral moves to the right and some point it disappears. So you have a singularity. At this point, your model is no longer valid. You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity, but you can observe again and you will see it in another spiral. And at this point it disappears. So we know of a second order law. And if you make thirty layers of these laws, then you have a description of the world that is similar to the one that we come up with. When we describe the reality around us, it's reasonably predictive. It does not cut to the core of it. So you explain how it's being generated, how it actually works. But it's relatively good to explain the universe of your entanglement. But you don't think the tools of computer size, of the tools of physics could get could step outside, see the whole drawing and get at the basic mechanism of how the pattern, the spirals are generated? Um, imagine you would find yourself embedded into a Mandelbrot fractal and you try to figure out what works. And you you know, some however, Turing machine, there's enough memory to think. And as a result, you come to this idea, it must be some kind of automaton and maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata until you get to the one that produces your reality so you can identify necessary and sufficient condition. For instance, if you discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages. And then we see that most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing the same fractals as what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different domains to each other so they're not that many fractals. And some of these have interesting structure and symmetry breaks. And so you can discover what region of this global fractal you might be embedded in from first principles. Yes, but the only way you can get there is from first principles. So basically your understanding of the universe has to start with automata and the number theory and then spaces and so on. Yeah, I think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams that he's that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules of the cellular automata or the generalization of which is behind our universe. Yeah, it's. You've said on this topic, you said in a recent conversation that, quote, Some people think that a simulation can't be conscious and only a physical system can. But it got a completely backward a physical system cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property that simulated itself. Just like you said, the mind is kind of the call it story narrative. There's a simulation or so our mind is essentially a simulation. And you live and I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically the principles that produced the simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain and the mind is creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that is on the other side of attention and is embedded in this world. Why is that important? That idea of a self was an important feature in the simulation. It's basically a result of the purpose that the mind has. It's a tool for modeling, right? We are not actually monkeys. We are side effects of the regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is the relationship of an organism to an outside world that is large part also consisting of other organisms. And as a result, it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to these regulation targets. It was Pryors. They are basically like unconditional reflexes that we are more or less born with, and then we can reverse engineer them to make them more consistent. And then we get more detailed models about how the world works and how to interact with it. And so these prayers that you commit to a largely targeted values that our needs, what approach set points and this deviation to the set point creates some urch, some tension. And we find ourselves living inside of feedback loops. Right. Consciousness emerges over dimensions of disagreements with the universe, things that you care. Things are not the way they should be, but you need to regulate. And so in some sense, the sense of self is the result of all the IDs that you are having. An ID is a regulation Trogir that you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about. Do you think is important? And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments of these IDs, you get free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you let go of all of them, you're completely free and you can enter Nirvana because you're done. And actually, this is a good time to pause and say thank you to a friend of mine, Gustaaf Soderstrom, who introduced me to your work. I wanted to give him a shout out. He's a brilliant guy. And I think the AA community is actually quite amazing and is a good representative that you are as well. Some I'm glad. First of all, I'm glad the Internet exists to exist where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study your writing and think about, you know, that's amazing. OK, but the you've kind of of this emergent phenomena of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard problem of consciousness? Can you just linger on it like why does it still feel like I understand you're kind of the self is an important part of the simulation? But why does the simulation feel like something? So if you look at a book by, say, George R.R. Martin, where the characters have plausible psychology and they stand on a hill because they want to conquer the city below the hill and they're done in it, and they look at the color of the sky and they are apprehensive and feel empowered and all these things. Why do they have these emotions? It's because it's written into the story. Right. And it's written to the story because it's an adequate model of the person that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing has happened to all of us. So it's basically a story that our brain is writing. It's not written in words. It's written in a perceptual content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what the person would feel if it existed. So it's a virtual person and you and me happen to be this virtual persons of this virtual person gets access to the language center and talks about the sky being blue and this is us. But hold on a second. Do I exist in your simulation? You do exist almost similar way as me. So their internal states that I that are less accessible for me that you have and so on, and my model might not be completely adequate. There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense, both you and me are some puppets to puppets that play in my mind and identify with one of them because I couldn't control one of the puppet directly and was the other one. I can create things in between. So, for instance, we can go in and interact and that even leads to a coupling to a feedback loop so we can think things together in a certain way or feel things together. But this coupling is itself not a physical phenomenon, is entirely a software phenomenon. It's the result of two different implementations interacting with each other. So that's interesting. So are you suggesting I like the way you think about it? Is the entirety of existence a simulation? And we're kind of each mind is a little sub simulation. That like, why don't you why doesn't your mind have access? To my mind's full state, like for the same reason that my mind doesn't have access to its own fault state, so what? I mean, there is no trick involved. So basically, when I know something about myself, it's because I made a model out of your brain is tasked with modeling what other parts of your brain are doing. Yes, but there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world in the physical sense that is repeatable experiments and so on. Yeah. How does that fit in to see the center of a simulation of the world? So why is it so why is everything so repeatable and not everything? There's a lot of fundamental physics experiments that are repeatable. For a long time, all over the place and so on, laws of physics, how does that fit in? It seems that parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long lived. So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something, you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics. So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result usually of some control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors and the things that are not stable, that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on. They tend to get weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that sustains complexity, which is required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of the universe that is very tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of interesting symmetries and also symmetry breaks that allow the creation of structure. But they exist where so there's such an interesting idea that mind is stimulation that's constructing the narrative. My question is just to try to understand how that fits with this with the entirety of the universe. You're saying that there's a region of this universe that allows enough complexity to create creatures like us. But what's the connection between the the brain, the mind and the broader universe which comes first, which is more fundamental? Is the is the mind a starting point? The universe is emergent. Is the universe the starting point? The minds are emergent. Um, I think quite clearly the latter is at least a much easier explanation because it allows us to make causal models and I don't see any way to construct an inverse causality. So what happens when you die to your mind simulation? Um, my implementation ceases. So basically the thing that implements myself will no longer be present, which means if I am not implemented on the minds of other people, the thing that I identify with this weird thing is I don't actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct. If I was the Dalai Lama. He identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama gets reborn not because he is confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being. He runs on a human being. He's basically a governmental software. Right. That is instantiated in every new generation. And you saw his advisors will pick someone who does this in the next generation. So if you identify with this, you are no longer human and you don't die in the sense the what dies is only the body of the human that you run on to kill the Dalai Lama, you would have to kill his tradition. And if we look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small part like this, most of us, for if you have children, you realize something lives on in them, or if you spark an idea in the world, something lives on or if you identify with the society around you because you are a part that you're not just a human being. Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama in the sense that you, Josh Harbach, is just a collection of ideas like you have this operating system on, which is a bunch of ideas live and interact. And then once you die, there kind of some of them jump off the should it put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction. It's not physically real. Your identity is not a physical concept. It's basically a representation of different objects on the same line. But identity. Lives and dies, are you attached? This is what's the fundamental thing is that the ideas that come together to form identity or each individual identity actually are fundamental thing. It's a representation that you can get agency over if you care. So basically you can choose what you identify if you want to, but it just seems. If if the mind is not real, it's not that the the birth and death is not a crucial part of it. Well, maybe I'm silly. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism. But it seems that the physical being, a physical object in this world is is an important aspect of birth and death. Like it feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die. The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the real world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to. Model reality was oscillators. It's all colors and sound in some sense. Have octaves. Yes. And it's because they are represented properly with oscillators. Right. So that's why colors form a circle of use and colors have harmonic sounds, have harmonics as a result of synchronizing oscillators in the brain. Right. So the world that we subjectively interact with is fundamentally the result of the representation mechanisms in our brain there mathematically to some degree, universal. There are certain regularities that you can discover in the patterns and not others, but the patterns that we get. This is not the real world. The world that we interact with is always made of too many parts to count. Right? So when you look at this table and so on, it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count them. So you only look at the aggregate dynamics that limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely many patterns of particles, what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get for geometry that you're interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that work in the limit that you get by building an infinite serious that converges for those parts where it converges its geometry, for those parts where it doesn't convergence. Chaos. Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the sort of the consciousness that's emergent in our narrative, that the consciousness gives it color, gives a feeling, gives a flavor. So I think the feeling flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a future has to all the other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe. The color is given by those aspects of the representation or the experiential color where you care about where you have identification's. There's something mean, something where you are the inside of a feedback loop. When the dimensions of of caring are basically dimensions of this motivational system that we emerge over the the meaning of the relations, the graph. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Like where does the maybe even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness to be sort of more systematic? Like what what what do you how do you think about consciousness? And consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention. It's a mechanism that has evolved for a certain type of learning. At the moment, our machine learning systems largely work by building chains of weighted sums of real numbers for some non-linearity. And you learn by typing and error signals all these different chain layers and adjusting the weights and these weighted terms. And you can approximate the most polynomial with this if you have enough training data. But the prices you need to change a lot of these weights. Basically, the arrow is piped backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures in the network and everything else evens out statistically. And only at this juncture, this is where you had the actual error in the network. You make the change there. This is a very slow process and our brains don't have enough time for that because we don't get old enough to play go the way that our machines learn to play golf. So instead, what we do is an attention based learning. We pinpoint the probable region in the network where we can make an improvement, and then we store the this binding state together with the expected outcome in a protocol and this ability to make indexed memories for the purpose of learning to revisit these commitments later. This requires a memory of the contents of our attention. Another aspect is when I construct my reality, I make mistakes. So I see things that turn out to be reflections or shadows and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features of my perception gave rise to a present construction of reality. So the system needs to pay attention to the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs to pay attention to whether it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system gets trained with the same mechanism. So it's reflexive, but also in part because your attention lapses if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. Right. So it's the thing that I'm currently seeing, just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream, or am I still paying attention to my percept? So you have to periodically go back. Whether you're still paying attention and if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the system becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying attention to itself and makes attention the object of its attention, I think this is the look of it. You wake up. So there's this so there's this attachment mechanism that's somehow self-referential that's fundamental to our consciousness is. So I'll just ask you a question. I don't know how much you're familiar with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. They use attentional mechanisms, something called Transformer's to learn patterns and sentences by allowing the network to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence and each individual. So like parametrized and make it learn about the dynamics of a sentence by having like a little window into the into the sentence. Do you think that's like a little step towards that adventure, which will take us to the intentional mechanisms from which consciousness can emerge? Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated language translation, there was an example that I find particularly funny when somebody tried to translate a text from English into German and it was a bit broke the window and the translation in German was a little mouse. It's about as Fensterman and in baseball Schlager. So to translate back into a bet it is flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bat. Yes. And it seemed to be the most similar to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating the concept into German in the same sentence. And this is a mistake that the transformer model is not doing because it's tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism in the transformer model is basically putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure that these concepts pop up later in the text. Yeah, and basically the individuals through the text. And it's why the system can learn things that other systems couldn't before it, which makes the, for instance, possible to write a text where it talks about the scientist and the scientist as a name and has a pronoun and it gets a consistent story about that thing. What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this or this meaning falls apart at some point. It loses track of this context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says has to refer to the same universe. And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention in the transformer model does not go beyond tracking identity. And faking identity is an important part of attention. But it's a different, very specific attentional mechanism. Um, and it's not the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness that we have just to linger on. What do you mean by identity in the context of language? So when you talk about language, you have different words that can refer to the same concept. Got it. And in the sense, basic concepts. So yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or in indexical sense that you say this word does not only refer to this class of objects, but it refers to a definite object to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story and is only referred by different ways in the language. So the language is basically a projection from a conceptual representation, from a scene that is evolving into discrete string of symbols and what the transformer is able to do. It learns aspects of this projection mechanism that other models couldn't learn. So have you ever seen artificial intelligence or any kind of construction idea that allows for unlike neural networks or perhaps within neural networks, that's able to form something where the space of concepts continues to be integrated? So what you're describing building a knowledge base, building this consistent, larger and larger set of ideas that would then allow for deeper understanding, Wittgenstein's thought that we can build everything from language, from basically a logical grammatical construct. And I think to some degree, this was also what Minsky believed. So that's why you focus so much on common sense reasoning and so on. And a project that was inspired by him was like like, um, there was special going on. Yes, of course. Ideas don't die. People die. And that's true, but and Otsego is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is going to converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, philosophical investigations was the notion of images. So images play an important role in Tractatus, the Tractatus, an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical, probing language, to design a logical language in which you can do actual philosophy that rich enough for doing this. And the difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually I think he decided that he was not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the largest program in A.I. And the solution as we see it today is we need more general functional approximation. There are functions, geometric functions that we learn to approximate that cannot be efficiently expressed and computed in a governmental language. We can, of course, build automata that go via number theory and so on to learn in algebra and then compute an approximation of this geometry. But to equate language and demitry is not an efficient way to think about it. So functional where you kind of just said that neural networks are sort of the approach anyone always takes is actually more general than than what can be expressed through language. Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed through language at the data rates at which we process grammatical language. OK, so you don't think so? You don't think languages. So you disagree with Wittgenstein. That language is not fundamental to agree with Wittgenstein. I just agree with the late Wittgenstein and I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein. I think that the Tractatus itself is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was written in the 20th century. But but language is not fundamental to cognition, intelligence and consciousness. So I think that language is a particular way or the natural language that we are using at a particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other. But the languages in which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense. So they work slightly different in more general expressions or functions. And I think the general nature of a model is you have a bunch of parameters. Um, these I have arranged the variances of the world and you have relationships between them, which are constraints which say if certain parameters have these values, then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very early insight in computer science. And I think the some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine. And the problem is the Boltzmann machine is that it has a measure of whether it's good is basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left and the constraints where the constraints don't quite match up. It's very difficult to despite having this global measure to train it, because as soon as you add more than trivially a few elements, parameters in the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture. And so the solution that Hinton and Sinofsky found was to use a restricted Bozman machine, which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Bozman machine, and only has the input and output layer. But there's limits to express the severity of the Boltzmann machines. So now he built a network of some of these primitive Bozman machines. And in some sense you can see almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we are using today, even though we don't use Bylsma machines at this point. But the idea of the machine is you take this model, you klemp some of the values to perception, and this forces the entire machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently perceive in this state as your model of the world. I think it's a very general way of thinking about models, but we have to use a different approach to make it work. And this is we have to find different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that trains the Boltzmann machine and the mechanism that makes the bottom machine settle into its state are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Bozman machine itself. That's the kind of mechanism that we want to develop. You're saying yes. So that's the direction in which I think our research is going to go. It's going to for instance, what you notice in perception is our perception models of the world are not probabilistic, but possible ballistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that are improbable but possible. Right, perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's possible, if it's coherent. Yeah, so if you see a tail coming after, you should be able to see this, even if it's unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the models or given the state of possibilities that it's very, very large and a set of perceptual features, how should you change the state of states of the model to get it to converge with your perception? Uh, but the the space of the space of ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing is perhaps not as large. I mean, that that's perhaps a pretty small degree of coherence that you need to achieve. Depends, of course, how deep your model school is. Uh, for instance, politics is very simple when you know very little about game theory and human nature. So the younger you are, the more obvious this is how politics would work, right? Yes. And because you get a aesthetics for relatively few inputs and the more layers you model, the more layers you model reality, the harder it gets to satisfy all the constraints. So, you know, the current neural networks are fundamentally supervised. Learning system with a feed for your network is back propagation to learn. What's your intuition about? What kind of mechanisms might we move towards to improve the learning procedure? Uh, I think one big aspect is going to be meta learning and architecture. Research starts in this direction. In some sense, the first wave of A.I. classical, either by identifying a problem and a possible solution and implementing the solution program that plays chess. And right now, we're in the second wave of A.I. So instead of writing the algorithm that implements this solution, we write an algorithm that automatically searches for an algorithm that implements the solution. So the learning system in some sense is an algorithm that itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem. Let go, of course, to heart to implement the solution by hand. But we can implement an algorithm that finds the solution. So now let's move to the third stage, right. The third stage would be meta learning. Find an algorithm that discovers a learning algorithm for the given domain or brain is probably not learning the system, but the metro learning system. This is one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way. If you look at the way our brain is, for instance, implemented, there is no central control that tells all the neurons how to wire up. Yes. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is a single celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fit. And it gets fed if it fails on average at the right time. Yes. And the the right time depends on the context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has. So it has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire, to get fit, or if you see it as a reinforcement, learning each and every neuron is in some sense making a hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to paper signal through the universe and tries to get positive feedback for it. And the entire thing is set up in such a way that it's robustly self organizing into a brain, which means you start out with different U.N. types that have different priors and on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward. And you put them into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment and then you can train it in a particular order and as a result, you get the organized brain. Yeah. So, OK, so the brain is a better learning system. There was a bunch of reinforcement learning agents and what I think you said. But just to clarify, where do the there's no centralized government that tells you here's a lost function, here's a lost function, here's a lost function. Like what? Who is who says what's the default? Or governments which imports lost functions on different parts of the brain? So we have differential attention. Some areas in your brain get especially rewarded when you look at faces. If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia, which basically means the inability to tell people apart by their faces. So and the reason that happens is because it was it had an evolutionary advantage, like evolution comes into play here about it. It's basically an extraordinary attention that we have for faces. I don't think that people have, as opposed agnosia, have a perceived defective brain. The brain just has an average attention for faces. So people as positive agnosia don't look at faces more than they look at Cupps. So the level at which they resolve the geometry of faces is not higher than the one that then four cups. And people that don't have prosopagnosia look, uh, obsessively at faces. Right? For me, it's impossible to move through a crowd without scanning the faces. And as a result, we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow us to discern mental states of people, so obviously we don't know 99 percent of the details of this matter learning system that our mind OK, but still, we took a leap from something much dumber to that from through the evolutionary process. Can you, first of all, maybe say how hard how big of a leap is that from our brain, from our ancestors to multicellular organisms? And is there something we can think about, about as we start to think about how to engineer intelligence? Is there something we can learn from evolution? In some sense, life exists because of the market opportunity of controlled chemical reactions. You compete with some chemical reactions and we win in some areas against the dumb combustion because we can harness those entropy gradients. But you need to add a little bit of energy in a specific way to harvest more energy. So we outcompeted combustion in many regions. We do what we try very hard because when we are in direct competition, we lose, right? Yeah. So because the competition is going to close the entropy gradients much faster than we can, right? Yes, you got it. That's quite so. Apollinaire. Yeah. Yeah. So basically we do this because every cell has a Turing machine built into it. It's like literally every right on the tape. And so everything that's more complicated than a molecule that just is a vortex around attractors, that means the Turing machine it for its regulation. And then you binds us together and you get next level organizational organism where the cells together implement some kind of software. And for me, a very interesting discovery in the last year was the word spirit, because I realized that what spirit actually means, it's an operating system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented, people needed this word, but they didn't have robots that they built themselves. Yet the only autonomous robots that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities and so on. And they all had spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant has an operating system, right? If you pinch the plant in one area, then there's going to have repercussions throughout the plant. Everything in the plant in some sense connected into some global aesthetics, like in other organisms. An organism is not a collection of cells, is a function that tells cells how to behave. And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing, like some of genetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of each salvors each other cell. All right. So what you're saying is the organism is a function that tells what's what what the cells, cells, what to do. And the function is an image emerges from the interaction of the cells. Yes. So it's basically a description of what the plant is doing in terms of microstates. Yeah. And the microstates, the physical implementation are too many of them to describe them. So the software that we use to describe what the plant is doing, the spirit of the plant is the software, the operating system of the plant. Right. This is a way in which we, the observers, make sense of the plant. Yes. And it's all for people. So people have spirits, which is their operating system, in a way, wideness aspects of that operating system that relate to how your body functions and others, how you socially interact, how you interact with yourself and so on. And you make models of that spirit. And we think it's a loaded term because it's from a presenter figure that we took the scientific age a long time to rediscover a term that is pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the difference is that we still see between the old world and the new world. Translation errors that over the centuries actually longer and that they were. Why do you say that, Spirit? Just to clarify, because I'm a little bit confused. So the that the word spirit is a powerful thing. But what did you see in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a spirit or. Jamie, I try to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say spirituality in the U.S., it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of culture. And a culture is in some sense, you could say, the spirit of a society that is long game. The thing that is becomes self-aware at a level above the individuals where you say if you don't do the following things, then the great, great, great grandchildren of our children will now have nothing to eat. Yes. So if you take this long scope, you try to maximize the length of the game that you are playing as a species. You realize that you are part of a larger thing that you cannot fully control. You probably need to submit to the ecosphere instead of trying to completely control it. Right. There needs to be a certain level at which you can exist as a species if you want to endure. And our culture is not sustaining this anymore. We basically made this bet with the Industrial Revolution that you can control everything. And the modern societies with basically unfettered growth led to a situation in which we depend on the ability to control the entire planet. And since we are not able to do that, as it seems, this cultural day, we realize that it doesn't have a future might be called our children generations, that it's a very optimistic thing, too. Yeah. So you can have this kind of intuition that our civilization you said culture, but you really mean this. The spirit of the civilization is the entirety of this civilization may not exist for long. Yeah. So what you can you can untangle that. What's your intuition behind that. So you kind of offline mentioned to me that the Industrial Revolution was kind of the moment we agreed to accept the offer sign on the paper, on the dotted line with the Industrial Revolution. We doomed ourselves. Can you elaborate on that? There's a suspicion. I, of course, don't know how it plays out. But of course, it seems to me that, um, in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over an entropic abyss for Stoutland, on the other side, it's relatively clear that you're cantilevers at some point going to break down into this entropic abyss and you have to pay the bill, OK? Russia is my first language and I'm also an idiot. But this is just two apes that are playing with a banana, trying to have fun by talking. OK, anthropic what and what's entropic, entropic and tropica. And so entropic in the sense of entropy and all entropic. Yes. So this and entropic was the other word, Abis, was that it's a big Porche. Our best Ebbetts. Yes. And Tropica based. So many of the things you say are poetic. It's kind of amazing. Right. Which which makes it even more poetic. Wittgenstein would be proud. So entropic. Abis. OK, let's let's rewind then. The Industrial Revolution. So well, how does that get us into the entropic abyss? So in some sense, we burned 100 million years worth of trees to get everybody plumping. Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number of people. So basically, since the were busy, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. Yes. And this only changed with the Enlightenment and the subsequent industrial revolution and in some sense, the Enlightenment, a feat of rationality and also freed our norms from the preexisting order gradually. It was a process that basically happened in feedback loops that it was not that just one caused the other. It was a dynamic that started and the dynamic worked by basically increasing productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the definition of poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die, which is in some sense the state that all animals on Earth are in. The definition of poverty is having enough so you can have only so many children as you can feed and if you have more, they die. Yes. And in our societies, you can basically have as many children as you want. They don't die. Right. So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to pay a price in terms of we have to insert ourselves in the law. We're supposed to treat them as if we have too many. So basically, everybody in the under middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to the individual families. Yes, because children, especially in the U.S., are super expensive to have. And you only are taken out of this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you're a superpower, it doesn't matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change. And these children are largely not going to die of hunger. So how does this lead us to self-destruction? So there's a lot of unpleasant properties about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to let our children survive even if they have diseases like I would have died before my mid 20s without modern medicine and most of my friends would have, as well as what many of us wouldn't live without the advantages of modern medicine and modern civilized society. We get our protein largely by subduing the entirety of nature. Now, imagine there would be some very clever microbe that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into a thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that, for instance, brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment changes. Yeah, but the some part of that organism and the one that's actually doing all the using of that, there are still be somebody thriving. So it relates back to this original question. I suspect that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every complex system has to have some complex regulation if if it depends on feedback loops. And so, for instance, it's likely to that we should ascribe a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is that plants don't have a nervous system, so they don't have a way to telegraph messages over large distances almost instantly in the plant. And instead they will rely on chemicals between adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with the rate of a few millimeters per second. Yes. And as a result, the if the plant is intelligent, it's not going to be intelligent at similar timescales as they believe. Put the timescales different. So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent, but we're we're the most intelligent and this scale in our timescale. So basically, if you would zoom out very far, you might discover that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet that existed for thousands of years and are almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these ecosystems activity related environments will basically change the course of the evolution within this ecosystem to make it more efficient and as brutal as possible. Something like plants is actually a set of living organisms, an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating a different timescale and are far superior and intelligent as human beings. And then human beings will die out and still be there and they'll be there. Yeah, they also there's an evolutionary adaptation playing a role that all of these levels, for instance, if mice don't get enough food and get stressed, the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny. And the reason for this is because the natural environment in mice have probably hit a drought or something else. And if they're overgraze, then all the things that sustain them might go extinct and there will be no mice a few generations from now. So to make sure that there will be mice in five generations from now, basically the mice scale back and a similar thing happens with the predators of mice. They should make sure that the mice don't completely go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked with shepherding their food supply. And maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains than antelopes is not so much because it's so hard to catch antelope as opposed to run away from the lion. But the lions need to make complex models of that environment more complex than the antelopes. So this is the first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human beings may not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on Earth makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about. Yes, you are just gorgeous ploy to put the carbon back into the atmosphere. This is just a nice you know, the big stain on evolution is not as it was trees. Earth evolved trees before they could be digested again. Right. There were no insects that could break all of them apart. Cellulose is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these trees. And two swamps and all this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into organisms, and we are the species that is destined to take care of that. So this is kind of dig it out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the earth is already greening. So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the rapid changes that they're not compatible with right now, there's going to be awesome again. And there won't be even a memory of us, of us little apes. I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first generally intelligent species in the sense you are the first species, this industrial society, because we believe more phones than bones in the stratosphere or see some bones. I like it. But then let me push back. I see you've kind of suggested that we have a very narrow definition of of I mean, why aren't trees more general on a higher level of general intelligence? That tree is more intelligent than they would be at different time scales, which means within a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as complex as the ones that we make in ten years. But maybe the trees are the ones that made the phones right. Like like you say, the entirety of life did it. You know, the first cell never died. The first cell only split. Right. And every divide it and every cell in our body is still an instance of the first cell that split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell on this planet, as far as we know. Yeah. And so the cell is not just a building block of life, it's a hyper organism. Yeah, right. And we are part of this hyper organism. So nevertheless, this hyper organism. No, the this little particular branch of it, which is us humans, because the industrial revolution and maybe the exponential growth of technology might somehow destroy our cells. So what what do you think is the most likely way we might destroy our cells? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we've talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial intelligence destroying us. Some people worry. Both nuclear weapons and weapons of war in general. What do you think, if you had to if you were a betting man, what would you bet on in terms of self-destruction? And there would be higher than 50? Would it be higher than 50 percent? So it's very likely that nothing that be bet on matters after we win our bet. So I don't think that bets are literally the right way to go about. I mean, once you're dead, it doesn't mean you won't be there to collect. So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably fewer people on the planet than are today. And even if not, then still, most of people that are alive today will not have offspring 100 years from now because of the geographic changes and so on and the changes in the food supply. It's quite likely that many areas of the planet are the only be livable was a close calling chain 100 years from now. So many of the areas around the equator and in a subtropical climate that are now quite pleasant to live in, but stop to be inhabitable without evolution. So you answer while cooling chain, close knit, cooling chain communities. So you think you have a strong worry about the the effects of global warming itself? It's not a big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three months in the summer in which you cannot be outside. Yes. And so you have a close cooling chain. You have air conditioning in your car and in your home, and you're fine. And if the air conditioning would stop for a few days, then in many areas you would not be able to survive. Can we just pause for a second? Like you say, so many brilliant poetic things like what is it? Is that do people use that term closed cooling chain? I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get meat into a supermarket. Right. It could break the cooling chain and starts to thaw you in trouble and you have to throw it away. The thing is, there's such a beautiful way to put it. So calling a city a closed social chain or something like that, I mean. That's right. I mean, the locality of is really what it basically means. You wake up in the climatized room, you go to work and the climatized car, you work in the shop and acclimatize supermarket. And in between you have very short distance, which you run from your car to the supermarket. But you have to make sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of the environment. So the crucial thing is the temperature. The what temperature is what you get when you take a wet clothes and you put it around your thermometer and then you move it very quickly through the air. So you get the evaporation heat. Yes. And as soon as you can no longer cool your body temperature by a pop operation to a temperature below something like, I think 35 degrees, you die. Right. And which means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down by sweating. But if it has a certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature, then sweating will not save you. And this means even if you're healthy, fit individual within a few hours, even if you try to be in the shade and so on your day, unless you have some climate deicing equipment and this itself, if you as long as you maintain civilization and you have energy supply and you have food trucks coming to your home that acclimatized, everything is fine. But what if you lose large scale, open every culture at the same time? So basically you run into food insecurity because climate becomes very irregular or weather becomes very irregular and you have a lot of extreme weather events. So you need to roll most of your food, maybe indoor, or you need to import your food from certain regions and maybe you're not able to maintain the civilization without the planet to get the infrastructure to get the food to your home. All right. But there could be so there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer. There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you do you not have a lot of faith? But what do you make of the capacity of technol technological innovation to help us prevent some of the worst damages that this condition can create? So that as an example, as an almost out there example, is the work of the space in the mosque is doing of trying to also consider our propagation throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets. That's one technological step. But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to save us on global warming because Mars looks much worse than planet Earth will look like after the worst outcomes of global warming imaginable. Right. Yet it is not habitable. It's exceptionally harsh environment. Yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people throughout history, since the Industrial Revolution are doing are just doing a lot of different technological innovation with some kind of target. And what ends up happening is totally unexpected. New things come up. So trying to trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars and extremely harsh environment might give us totally new ideas of how to expand that or increase the power of this closed cooling circuit that that empowers the community. So, like, it seems like there's a little bit of a race between our open ended technological innovation of this, uh, communal operating system that we have and our general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy ourselves. You don't think technology can win that race? I think the probability is relatively low, given that our technology is poor in the US is stagnating since the 1970s, roughly in terms of technology. Most of the things that we do are the result of incremental processes. What about Intel? What about Moore's Law? It's basically it's very incremental. The things that we are doing is so after the invention of the microprocessor was a major thing, right? The militarisation of transistors was really major, but the things that we did afterwards largely were not that innovative. So structural changes of, uh, scaling things into use into, uh, from CPUs into depots and things like that. But I don't think that there are. Basically, there are not many things if you take a person that died in the 70s and was at the top of their game, they would not need to read that many books to be current again. But it's all about books. Who cares about books? The there might be things that are beyond books, might be papers or other papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are so papers and books and knowledge that that's a concept of a time when you were sitting there by candlelight and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not in the middle of? We're not might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube. The reason you and I are sitting here today is because of Twitter and YouTube. So the the ripple effect and there's there's two minds, sort of two dumb apes are coming up with a new perhaps a new clean insights. And there's two hundred other apes we're seeing right now, 200000 other apes listening right now. And that effect, it's very difficult to understand what that effect will have that might be bigger than any of the advancements of the microprocessor or the industrial revolution, the ability of spread knowledge. And that that that knowledge, the it allows good ideas to reach millions much faster. And the effect of that, that might be the new that might be the 21st century is the multiply the multiplying of ideas of good ideas. Because if you say one good thing today that will multiply across, you know, huge amounts of people and then they will say something and then they will have another podcast and they'll say something and then they'll write a paper that that could be a huge. You don't think that. Yeah, we should have billions fun for humans right now, for fundaments right now and Turing's. And if you don't for some reason, I suspect the reason is that you destroy our attention span. Also the incentives, of course, different incarnations. Yeah. So the reason why we're sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because you and me don't have the attention span to write a book together right now and you guys probably don't have the attention span to read it. So let me guarantee you the listening bursts of your attention. It's very short, but we're you know, we're an hour and 40 minutes in and I guarantee you that 80 percent of the people are still listening. So there is an attention span. It's just the form. You know, who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information? That's still an open question. And that's what we're something that social media could be doing that other forms could not be doing. I think the end game of social media as a global brain and Twitter is in some sense a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine, doesn't have any kind of inhibition. And as a result, it's caught in a permanent seizure. Yes, it's also, in some sense, a multiplayer role playing game. And people use it to play an avatar that is not like them as they were in Seinfeld. And they look through the world, through the lens of their phones and think it's the real world, but it's the Twitter about the distorted by the popularity incentives of Twitter. Yet the the incentives and just there are natural biological. The dopamine rush of the like, no matter how like I consider I tried to be very kind of Zen like and minimalist and not be influenced by likes and so on. But it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some degree. Speaking at a small tangent of Twitter, what how can be how can Twitter be done better? I think it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society by doing exactly what you're doing or doing exactly what you described, which is having this. At the like, is this some kind of game and we're kind of individual early in this game and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a centralized control, neither Jack Dorsey nor the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control this game or can they? That's sort of a question. Is there any advice you would give? And how to control this device, because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this and I think our brain is has solved this problem to some degree, but our brain has lots of individual agents that manage to play together in a way. And you have also many context in which other organisms have found ways to solve the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter. And maybe the solution is to go for an evolutionary approach. So imagine that you have something like Reddit or something like Facebook and something like Twitter, and you think about what they have in common, what they have in common, their companies that in some sense own a protocol. And this protocol is imposed on a community. And the protocol has different components for monetization, for user management, for user display, for rating, for anonymity, for import of other content and so on. And now imagine that you take these components of the protocol apart. And your tweets in some sense, like communities within this social network and these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and design new ones. So, for instance, the UI and the UCS can be defined by the community. The rules for sharing content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you reward individual users for what can be redefined, the way users can represent themselves and to each other can be redefined and could be redefined. So can individual human beings build enough intuition to redefine itself can become part of the protocol. So, for instance, it could be in some communities it will be a single person that comes up with these things and others. It's a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self organizing principle for this? But the process can be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain can be automated so people can write software for this. And eventually the idea is let's not make an assumption about this thing. If you don't know what the right solution is and those areas that you have no idea whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc or machines doing this, whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia or Orvis Software Solutions or the A.I. that goes through the posts of people or is a legal principle and so on, this is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would be if you let the communities evolve and you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing the more sentient and communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors and that allow you to interact in the most helpful ways to the individuals. Right. Do you have a network that gives you information that is relevant to you? It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy ways. It allows you to build teams. It allows you to basically to bring the best of you into this thing and goes into a coupling, into a relationship with others in which you produce things that you would be unable to produce alone. Yes, beautifully put. So but the key process of that with incentives and evolution is things that don't adapt themselves to effectively get the incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or whatever you want to define as the incentives really don't like dying. One of the things that people really get aggressive protests aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America. I don't know I don't know much about the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech, the idea of censorship is really painful in America. And so. What yeah, what do you think about that, having grown up in East Germany? What do you think? Censorship is an important tool in our brain, in the intelligence and in the social networks. So basically, if you're not a good member of the entirety of the system, you should be blocked away, locked away, blocked. An important thing is who decides that you are a good member who is a distributed or what is the outcome of the process that decides it both for the individual and for society at large. For instance, if you have a high trust society, you don't need a lot of surveillance. And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining trust. Yes, because it's basically punishing people that look suspicious when surveyed but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite. If you have a low trust society and then surveillance can be a better trade off. And the US is currently making the transition from a relatively high trust or mistrust society to a low trust society. So surveillance will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are not just innate representations. There are implementations that run code on your brain and change reality and change the way you interact with each other at some level. And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we used to display our alignment. So, for instance, people might say all cultures have are the same and equally good. But still they prefer to live in some cultures of others very, very strongly so. And it turns out that their cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction, and these rules of interaction lead to different results when you implement them. Right. So if you adhere to certain rules, you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very tricky situations when people do not have a commitment to a shared purpose. And our societies probably need to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how to make this compatible with a non totalitarian view. So in some sense, this is caught in a conundrum between totalitarianism and diversity and doesn't need to how to resolve this and the solutions that the U.S. has found so far, very crude because it's a very young society that is also under a lot of tension. That seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself. What do you think? Just the philosophising. What kind of mechanisms of government do you think we as a species should be evolving with us? Or broadly, what do you think will work well? As a system, of course, we don't know, it all seems to work pretty crappy, some things worse than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then completely discarding the positive effects of government. You know, there's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing pretty damn well in the span of history. There's respect for human rights, which seems to be a nice feature, not a bug. And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development. People seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things. Well, what lessons do you draw from that? What kind of government system do you think is good? Ideally, governments should not be perceivable, right? It should be frictionless. The more you notice the influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective and efficient the government probably is. Right. So a government game, theoretically, is an agent that imposes an offset on your payout metrics to make your equilibrium compatible with the common good. So you have these situations where the high incentives and these local incentives, everybody does the thing that's locally the best for them. But the global outcome is not good. And there's even the case when people care about the global outcome because a regulation mechanism exists that creates a causal relationship between what I want to have for the global good and what I do. So, for instance, if I think that we should fly less and I stay at home, there's not a single plane that is going to not start because of me. Right? It's not going to have an influence, but I don't get from A to B. So the way to implement this would be to have a government that is sharing this idea that we should fly less and is then imposing a regulation that, for instance, makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for inventing other forms of transportation that are less, um, putting that strain on the environment, for instance. So there's so much optimism and so many things you describe. And yet there's the pessimism of you think our civilization is going to come to an end. So that's not a 100 percent probability. Nothing in this world is. So what's the trajectory out of self-destruction, do you think? I suspect that in some sense we are both too smart and not smart enough, which means we are very good at solving near-term problems. And at the same time, we are unwilling to submit to the, uh, to the imperatives of that we would have to follow. And if you want to stick around. Right. So that makes it difficult. If you were unable to solve everything technologically, you can probably understand how wide the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate and why the mutation mutation rate needs to be to adapt to a slowly changing systemic environment. Right. So you could in principle, compute all these things, came theoretically and adapt to it. But if you cannot do this because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die, you will use any kind of medical information to keep child mortality low, even if it means that our within a few generations we have enormous genetic drift and most of us have allergies as a result of not being adapted. But the changes that we made to our food supply, that's for now. I say technologically speaking, which is a very, very, very young, you know, 300 years industrial revolution, were very new to this idea. So you're attached to your kids being alive and not being murdered for the greater good of society. But that might be a very temporary moment of time. Yes. That we might we might evolve. And I think it's so like you said, when we're both smart and not smart enough, are probably not the first human civilization that has, uh, discovered technology to allow us to efficiently overgraze our resources and this overgrazing thing. At some point, we think we can compensate this, because if we have eaten all the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms. Right. But it could also be that the ecosystems tip. And so what really concerns me is not so much the end of the civilization because we will invent a new one. But what concerns me is, um, the fact that, for instance, the oceans might tip. So, for instance, maybe the plankton dies because of ocean acidification and cyanobacteria take over and as a result, we can no longer breathe the atmosphere. This would be really concerning. So basically, Major, we would of most complex organisms on Earth. And I think this is a possibility. I don't know if what the percentage for this possibility is, but it doesn't seem to be outlandish to me. If you look at the scale of the changes that we've already triggered on this planet and so many others, such that, for instance, we may be able to put Targ into the stratosphere to, uh, limit solar radiation, maybe it works. Maybe this is sufficient to counter the effects of what we've done. Maybe it won't be maybe we won't be able to implement it by the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future is going to play out in this regard. It's just, uh, I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue like this. All our cousins species, the other hominids are gone. So so the right step would be to what? To rewind to working towards the industrial revolution and slow the search to try to contain the technological process that leads to overconsumption of resources? Um, I imagine you get to choose. You have one lifetime. Yes. You get born into a sustainable agricultural civilization, 300, maybe 400 million people on the planet, tops, or before this, some kind of nomadic species like a million or two million. And so you don't meet new people unless you give birth to them. You cannot travel to other. Places in the world, there is no Internet, there is no interesting intellectual tradition that reaches considerably deep, so you would not discover your incompleteness probably, and so on, we wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get born into an insane world. One that is doomed to die because it has just burned 100 million years worth of trees in a single century, which I do like, I think I like this one. It's a very weird thing that when you find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks like we are not going to miss it and a lot of people are in denial. And most of the counterarguments sound like denial to me. They don't seem to be rational arguments. And the other thing is we are born on this Titanic. Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have been born. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be talking. We wouldn't be on the Internet. We wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy. And we are not responsible for this happening. It's basically, if he had the choice, we would probably try to prevent it. But when we were born, we were never asked when we want to be born, which society we want to be born, what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. If you have relatively little agency in the entire thing, humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's basically a giant machine. It's tumbling down a hill and everybody is frantically trying to push them buttons. Nobody knows what these buttons are, meaning what they connect to. And most of them are not stopping this tumbling down the hill. Is it possible that artificial intelligence will give us. An escape latch somehow, so the you know, there's a lot of worry about existential threats of of artificial intelligence, but what I also allows in general forms of automation allows the potential of extreme productivity growth that will also perhaps in a positive way, transform society that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the more to the same kind of ideals of closer to nature that's represented in Hunter-Gatherer societies. You know, that's not destroying the planet, that's not doing overconsumption and so on. I mean, generally speaking, do you have hope that I can help some? I think it's not fun to be very close to nature until you completely subdue nature. So our idea of being close to nature means being close to agriculture. Basically, the forests that don't have anything in them that eats us. See, I mean, I want to disagree with that. I, I think the niceness of being close to nature is to being fully present in like one's survival becomes your primary, not just your goal, but your whole existence. Mm hmm. It. I mean, that is a I'm not just romanticizing. I can just speak for myself. I am self-aware enough that that is that is a fulfilling existence and one that's very good to be in nature and not fight for my survival. I think fighting in yourself for your survival while being in the cold and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having open wounds is very unpleasant. Well, there's a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you, just, as you said, would not choose it. But if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling existence adapted to it. Basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you will get rewards optimally in such an environment. And is some evidence for this that for a certain degree of complexity, basically people are more happy in such an environment because it's what you largely have evolved for in between. We had a few thousand years in which I think we have evolved a slightly more comfortable environment. So there is probably something like an intermediate stage in which people would be more happy than there would be if they would have to fend for themselves in small groups in the forest and often die versus something like this, where we now have basically a big machine, a big Mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons and machines and largely don't feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are so returning briefly to. Not briefly, but returning to a what? Let me ask a romanticised question. What is the most beautiful to you, silly ape, the most beautiful, surprising idea in the development of artificial intelligence, whether in your own life or in the history of artificial intelligence that you've come across. If you built an A.I., it probably can make models at an arbitrary degree of detail. Right. Of the world. And then it would try to understand its own nature. It's tempting to think that at some point when we have general intelligence, we have competitions for people, that the apes wake up in different kinds of physical universes and we measure how many movements of the Rubik's Cube it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe and what it is in its own nature and its own physics and so on. Right. So what if we exist in the memory of an AI that is trying to understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and remembers Lex and Joshua sitting in the hotel, sparking some of the ideas of that led to the development of general intelligence, where a kind of simulation that's running in our system is trying to understand itself. It's not that I believe that, but I think it's a beautiful I mean, um. Yeah, you kind of return to this idea with the Turing test of intelligence being of intelligence being the process of asking and answering. What is intelligence? I mean, what? Why do you think there's there is an answer, why is there such a search for an answer? So does there have to be and they can I can answer you just said an assistant that's trying to understand the why of what you don't understand itself. Is that a fundamental. Process of greater and greater complexity, greater greater intelligence is the continuous trying of understanding itself. No, I think you will find that most people don't care about that because they're well adjusted enough to not care. And the reason why people like you and me who care about it probably has to do with the need to understand ourselves. It's because beyond fundamental disagreement with the universe, that we wake up and look down at me and I see, oh, my God, I'm quite in a monkey. What's that feeling? Right. The government and I'm unhappy with the entire universe that I find myself in. So you don't think that's a fundamental aspect of human nature, that some people are just suppressing, that they wake up shocked they're in the body of a monkey? No, there is a clear adaptive value to not be confused by that and by. Well, no, that's not what is. So so you have to clear adaptive value then. There's clear adaptive value to while fundamental, your brain is confused by that by creating an illusion, another layer of the narrative that says, you know, that tries to suppress that and instead say that, you know, what's going on with the government right now is the most important thing. What's going on with my football team is the most important thing. But it seems to me the like for me was a really interesting moment reading Ernest, because denial of death that, you know, this kind of idea that we're all, you know, the fundamental thing from which most of our human mind springs is this fear of immortality, of being cognizant of your mortality and the fear of that mortality. And then you construct illusions and top of that. I guess I'm you being just to push on it, you really don't think it's possible that this worry of the big existential questions is actually fundamental as far as the existentialist thought to our existence? I think that the view of this only plays a role as long as you don't see the big picture. The thing is that mines are software states, right? Software doesn't have identity software in some sense as a physical law. But I can write software, but it feels like there's an identity. I thought that was there for this particular piece of software and the narrative it tells there's a fundamental property of it. Signing and maintenance of the identity is not terminal. It's instrumental to something else. You maintain your identity so you can serve your meaning, so you can do the things that you're supposed to do before you die. And I suspect that for most people, the fear of death is the fear of dying before they are done with the things that they feel they have to do, even though they cannot quite put their finger on it. But it is what that is, right? But in the software world, the return to the question then, what happens after we die? So because what you care, you will not be longer there to the point of dying is that you are gone. Well, maybe I'm not. This is what you know. It seems like there's so much in the idea that this is just the mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wavefunction world that we can't quite get direct access to. Then, like the idea of mortality seems to be fuzzy as well. It doesn't maybe there's not a clear and fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don't have continuous existence. How do you know that? Like that? It's not computable because you're saying it's good. It's not a continuous process. The only thing that binds you together with the next Friedemann from yesterday is the illusion that you have memories about him. So if you want to upload, it's very easy. You make a machine that thinks it's you because it's the same thing that you are. You are a machine that thinks it's you. But that's that's more that's immortality. Yeah, but it's just a belief you can create this body very easily once you realize that the question whether you are immortal or not depends entirely on your beliefs and your own continuity. But then then then then you can be immortal by the continuity of the belief you cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid of your mortality because you realize you will never, never continuously exist in the first place. What I don't know if I'd be more terrified or less terrified by that. It seems like the fact that I existed. So you don't know the state in which you don't have a self. You can turn off your self, you know. I can't turn you can't turn it off, you can turn it off. I can. Yes, you can basically meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious. There's still things are happening. But, you know, everything that you knew before, but you're no longer identified with changing anything. And this means that yourself and it dissolves. There is no longer this person, you know, that this person construct exists and other states and it runs on this brain of Lex Friedman. But it's it's not a real thing. It's a construct. It's an idea. And you can change that idea. And if you let go of this idea, if you don't think that you are special, you realize it's just one of many people and it's not your favorite person even. Right. It's just one of many. And it's the one that you are doomed to control for the most part. And that is basically informing the actions of this organism. Yeah, as a control model, this is all there is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model gets interrupted or loses the identity of continuity. Yes, I'm attached. I mean, yeah, there is a very popular it's somehow a compelling notion that being being attached, like there's no need to be attached to this idea of an identity. But that in itself could be a an illusion that you can structure the process of meditation, while popular, is thought of as getting under the concept of identity. It could be just putting a cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment, you know? I think that meditation is eventually just a bunch of techniques that let you control attention and when you can control the attention, you can get access to your own source code. Hopefully not before you understand what you were doing. And then you can change the way it works, temporarily or permanently. So, yeah, meditation's get a glimpse at the source code, get under basically control or the entire thing is that you learn to control attention. So everything else is downstream from controlling attention and control the attention that's looking at the attention, not only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat where you have a mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people are not self aware because their control is too good if everything works out roughly the way you want. And the only things that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will mostly have models about these comments. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental relationships to the world around you don't work because the ideology of your country is insane and the other kids are not nerds and don't understand why you understand physics and you don't know why you want to understand physics and you don't understand why somebody would not want to understand physics. So we've kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents. And there's been some successes, as you brought up with a go figure of zero with ideas of self play, which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing each other and in an automated way to improve by playing other systems of in a particular construct of a game that are a little bit better than itself and thereby improving continuously. All the competitors in the game are improving gradually. So being just challenging enough and learning from the process of the competition, do you have hope for that reinforcement learning process to achieve greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different ideas and I think we need to be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an ajai system? So do think the forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many algorithms that can achieve that. And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms that work there will be a class of them were many of them, and they might have small differences of like magnitude and efficiency. But eventually what matters is the type of model that you form and the types of models that we form right now are not fast enough. There. What does it mean to be sparse? It means that ideally every potential model state should correspond to a potential world state. So obviously, if you're very states and your model, you always end up as well. Valid world states, in your mind is not quite there. So an indication is we see what we see in dreams. The older we get, the more boring our dreams become because we incorporate more and more constraints that we learned about how the world works. So many of the things that we imagine to be possible as children turn out to be constrained by physical and social dynamics. And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain possible and not because our imagination scales back, but the constraints under which it operates become tighter and tighter. And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate are almost limitless, which means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine things that look real. Right. So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to build dreaming systems. I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is to similar to a generative adversarial network, learn certain constraints, and then it produces alternative perspectives on the same set of constraints so you can recognize it under different circumstances. Maybe we have flying dreams as children because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps that we know from different perspectives, which also means from the bird's eye perspective. So I mean, aren't we doing that anyway? I mean, not without with our eyes and with our eyes closed when we're sleeping and we just constantly running dreams and simulations in our mind as we try to interpret the environment. I mean, it's sort of considering all the different possibilities for the way we interact with the environment, seems like. Essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of simulations that are consistent with our expectations, with previous experiences, with the things we just saw recently and through that hallucination process, we are able to then somehow stitch together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well and thereby interpret it. I suspect that your and my brain are slightly unusual in this regard, which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession of constantly pondering possibilities and solutions to problems. Oh, stop it. I think. I'm not talking about intellectual stuff. I'm talking about just doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall. I guess this is largely automatic. Yes, but the process is I mean, it's not complicated, it's relatively easy to build a neural network that in some sense learns the dynamics, the fact that we haven't done it right so far. It doesn't mean it's hard because you can see that a biological organism does it, because relatively few neurons, you build a bunch of neural oscillators that can train themselves the dynamics of your body in such a way that the regulator becomes isomorphic and it's model to the dynamics that it regulates and then is automatic. And it's only interesting in the sense that it captures attention when the system is off. But thinking of the kind of mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller is like a as a as a neural network. I think I think it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly or at least makes implicit the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning to walk. That's not is an open question whether you do or not. But my intuition is to be to act in this world. There's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it. Somehow. There's so much information of the kind we have never been able to construct in our in neural networks and artificial intelligence systems, period, which is like it's humbling, at least in my imagination. The amount of information required to act in this world humbles me. And I think seeing that in all that we can accomplish is missing. Is missing the fact that we don't. Yeah, we don't have yet a mechanism for constructing something like common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense? About. To linger on how much, you know, to linger on the idea of what kind of mechanism would be effective at walking, you said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have, but something a little bit better would be able to walk easily, don't you think? It also needs to know. Huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning, how much common sense knowledge to be actually have imagined that you are really hard working through all your life and your form to new concepts every half hour. So you end up with something like a million concepts because you don't get that old. So a concept. That's not a lot. So it's not just the million concepts, I think it would be a lot, I personally think it might be much more than a million. If you think just about the numbers, you don't live that long. If you think about how many cycles to your neurons have in your life, it's quite limited. You don't get that old yet. But the powerful thing is the number of concepts in there, probably deeply hierarchical in nature. The relations, as you described between them, is the key thing. So it's like even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's formed and some kind of perhaps some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's the that's what's common sense reasoning is the relationship between things that are so bad in some sense. I think of the concepts as the address space for our behavior programs and the behavior poems allow us to recognize objects and interact with them. Also mental objects. And large part of that is the physical world that we interact with, which is this extend I thing, which is basically unification of information and space. And basically it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine that you can use to describe and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them a particular way, the appropriate sceptical of auditory perception and so on, how they work out. So basically the geometry of all these things, and this is probably 80 percent of what our brain is doing is dealing with that. There's this real time simulation and by itself, a game engine is fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's doing. Right. And our game engines are already, in some sense, approximating the fidelity of what we can perceive. So if we put on an Oculus quest, if you get something that is still relatively crude with respect to what we can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark already, right. It's just a couple order of magnitude away to home saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that it can produce. So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that our computer that you can buy it put into your home is able to give a perceptual reality that has the detail that is already in the same ballpark as what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about social interaction, social interaction is is not so hard. It's just hard for us nerds because we all have our wires crossed. So we need to use them. But the players are present in most social animals. So it's interesting thing to note is that many domestic social animals, like cats and dogs, have better social recognition than children. Right? I hope so. I hope it's not that many concepts fundamentally had to do to exist in this world. So for me, it's more like I'm afraid so, because this thing that we only appear to be so complex to each other because we're so stupid, it's a little bit depressing now. One that to me that's inspiring if we're indeed as stupid as it seems, thinks our brains don't scale and the information processing that we built tend to scale very well. Yeah, but I mean, one of the things that worries me is that, you know, the fact that the brain doesn't scale means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain. You know, the all the flaws of the brain, everything we see that we see as limitations, perhaps as a fundamental, the constraints on the system could be the a requirement of its power, which is like different than our current understanding of intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with reinforcement learning. The the hope behind open and mind, all the major results really have to do with huge computer. And yet also be that our brains are so small, not just because they take up so much glucose in our body, 20 percent of the glucose, so they don't arbitrarily scale. But there are some animals like elephants, which have larger brains than us, and it don't seem to be smarter. All right. Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and they're very good with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture so you can make them recreate drawing's stroke by stroke. They can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life. So they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. There will always be only able to reproduce the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments. So why is that? Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence because their brains are actually basically the elephants that were not autistic. Uh, they didn't reproduce. Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain is fundamentally interlinked with the body and our human and the biological system. Do you think that ajai systems that we try to create or greater intelligence systems would need to have a body? So I think they should be able to make use of a body if you give it to them. But I don't think that a fundamental interbody, so I suspect if you can interact with the world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make controlled experiments. And this allows you to have many magnitudes fewer observations in order to reduce the uncertainty in your models so you can pinpoint the errors in your models, but you're not quite sure. And you just move your head and see what's what's going on over there. And you get additional information. If you just have to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this, you probably need just much more data. But if you have much more data, so if you can build a system that has enough time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there is to be found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do. But it seems that the interactivity is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows you to do. But let me ask on that topic sort of that that sort of body is is allowing the brain to, like, touch things and move things and interact with the way whether the physical world exists or not, whatever, but interact with some interface to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think. Do you think we can do the same kind of reasoning, consciousness, intelligence, if we put on a VR headset and move over to that world? Do you think there's a fundamental difference between the interface, the physical world, that it's here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in a virtual world? The question is, does this physical, this non-physical world or this other environment entice you to solve problems that require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop general intelligence. And arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't have to solve problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear if we are smart enough to understand our own nature to this degree. Right. So it could be a matter of capacity. And for most people, it's in the first place, a matter of interest. I don't see the point because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because you're probably not going to succeed in it. And the cost of trying to do it requires complete dedication of your entire life. Right. But it seems like the possibilities of what you can do in the virtual world. So imagine that is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a situation and be interesting option for me. If somebody came to me and offered, what I'll do is so from now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. And so you put on a headset and when you eat will make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the virtual world, your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world. So the aligning incentives between the common sort of real world in the virtual world, but then the possibilities become much bigger, like I could be other kinds of creatures I could do. I can break the laws of physics as we know them. I could do a lot of I mean, the possibilities are endless, right? That's as far as we think. It's an interesting thought whether like what existence would be like what kind of intelligence would emerge there, what kind of consciousness, what kind of maybe greater intelligence even mean me, Allex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend the next 20 years in the world to see how that intelligence emerges. And if I was if that happened at the very beginning before I was even cognizant of my existence in this physical world, it's interesting to think how that child would develop and the way virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving. It's not completely out of the realm of possibility that we're all that some part of our lives will be, if not entirety of it, will live in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have living on Twitter and social media and so on. Do you have I mean, does something draw you intellectually or naturally in terms of thinking about AI to this virtual world where more possibilities? I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it. The body gives you a second order agency. What you consider what constitutes the body is the things that you can indirectly control. Third order tools, right? And the second order is the things that are basically always present. But you operate on them first order things which are mental operators. Yes. And the zero order is in some sense the direct sense of what you're deciding. Right. So you do observe yourself initiating an action. There are features that you interpret as the initiation of an action. Then you perform the operations that you perform to make that happen. And then you see the movement of your limbs and you learn to associate those and thereby model your own agency or the feedback. Right. But the first feedback that you get is from this first order thing already. Basically, you decide to think a thought and the thought is being thought. You decide to change. Thought and you observe how the thought is being changed, and in some sense this is, you could say, the embodiment already, right? And I suspect it's sufficient as an embodiment of intelligence. And so it's not that important, at least at this time, to consider variations in the second order. Yes, but the thing that you also put mentioned just now is physics, that you could change in any way you want. So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If you if there's nothing to control, you cannot make models. Right. There needs to be a particular way that resists you. And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists your motivation is what gets you up in the morning, even though it would be much less work to stay in bed. And so it's basically forcing you to resist the environment and it forces your mind to serve it, to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything. Yeah, so some of the resistance, just like you describe as motivation, is like in the first order, it's in the mind some resistance is in the second order, like actual physical objects pushing against you. So. It seems that the second order stuff in virtual reality could be recreated, of course, but it might be sufficient that you just do mathematics. And mathematics is already putting up enough resistance against you. So basically, just as an aesthetic motive, this could maybe sufficient to form a type of intelligence. It would probably not be a very human intelligence, but it might be one that is already general. So to to mess with this zero order, maybe first order, what do you think about ideas of brain computer interfaces? So, again, returning to our friend Elon Musk and Neural Link, a company that's trying to of course, there's a lot of trying to cure diseases and so on with the near term. But the long term vision is to add an extra layer to so basically expand the capacity of the brain connected to the computational world. Do you think one that's possible, too. How does that change the fundamentals of the zeroth order in the first order? It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would ever allow me to drill holes in my skull, to interface my neocortex, to unmask envisions so that the moment I can do horrible things to myself, but I'm not able to do useful things to people, except maybe at some point down the line in medical applications. So this thing that we are envisioning, which means recreational and creation of brain computer interfaces, are probably not going to happen in the present legal system. I love it how I'm asking you out there, philosophical and sort of engineering questions. And for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA. There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes in their skull to try a new type of brain computer interface. Also, if it works. FDA will approve it. I mean, yes, you're it's like because, you know, I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes. You can say there's going to be very difficult regulatory process of approving it, but it doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are never going to happen. So, no, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least two lawyers and one regulator per car. Yes, lawyers that's actually like lawyers is the fundamental substrate of reality. It's a very weird system. It's not universal in the world. It's a law. It's a very interesting software. Once you realize it right. These circuits are in some sense streams of software. And this is largely Boksburg exception handling. So you make decisions on the ground and they get synchronized with the next level structure as soon as an exception is being thrown. It's a yeah, so. So that's the exception, handling the process. It's very expensive, especially since it's incentivizes the lawyers for producing a lot of work for lawyers. Yes. So the exceptions are actually incentivized for for for firing often. But but to return outside of lawyers, is there anything fundamentally like is there anything interesting, insightful about the possibility of this extra layer of intelligence added to the brain? I do think so, but I don't think that you need, uh, technically invasive procedures to do so. We can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting in some kind of empathetic resonance. And I'm nervous. I'm not very good at this, but I notice that people are able to do this to some degree. And it basically means that we model an interface layer of the other person in real time, and it works despite our new ones being slow, because most of the things that we do are built on periodic processes. We just need to train yourself with the oscillation that happens. And if the oscillation itself changes slowly enough, you can basically follow along. All right. But the bandwidth of the interaction, the you know, it seems like you can do a lot more computation when there's, of course, the but the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is running on is actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively think in any given day is quite limited. But it's much if they had the discipline to write it down and the speed to write it down, maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think about the computers that we can build the magnitudes at which they operate. Right, this would be nothing. It's something that they can put out in a second. Well, I don't know. So as possible, sort of the number of thoughts you have in your brain is it could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able to express through your fingers or through your voice. Like most of them are going to be repetitive because. Well, how do you know that they have to control the same problems every day when they walk, they are going to be processed. This my brain, that model, my walking pattern and regulate them and so on. But it's going to be pretty much the same every day. But that is every step. But I'm talking about an intellectual reason. I'm thinking so the question, what is the best system of government? So you sit down and start thinking about that. One of the constraints is that you don't have access to a lot of like you have access to a lot of facts, a lot of studies you have to do. You always have to interface with something else to learn more to to aid in your reasoning process. If you can directly access all of Wikipedia in trying to understand what is the best form of government, then every thought won't be stuck in a like every thought that requires some extra piece of information will be able to grab it really quickly. That that's the possibility of if the bottleneck is literally the information that, you know, the bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just being able to quickly access huge amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting your brain to the computer could lead to totally new, like, you know, totally new breakthroughs. You can think of mathematicians being able to, you know, just up the orders of magnitude of power in their reasoning about mathematics and humanity has already discovered the optimal form of government or evolutionary process. There is an evolutionary well. And so what we discover is that maybe the problem of government doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species because we are not designed in such a way that we can make everybody conform to them. So but there could be solutions that work under different circumstances or that are the best for certain environment and depends on, for instance, the primary forms of ownership and the means of production, or if the main means of production is land and then there are forms of government will be regulated by the landowners and you get a monarchy. If you also want to have a form of government in which a substantial you depend on some form of slavery, for instance, where the peasants have to work very long hours for very little gain. So very few people can have plumbing, then maybe you need to promise them that you get paid in the afterlife that over time. Right. So you need a theocracy. And so for much of human history in the West, you had a combination of monarchy and theocracy. That was our form of governance. Right. At the same time, the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently reread Thomas Aquinas. It's very interesting to see this because he was not duelist. He was translating Aristotle in a particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. And he says that basically people are animals and very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically organism for cybernetic control. And then he says that there are individual rational principles that humans can discover and everybody can discover them. So there are universal if you are saying you should understand, you said to submit to them because you can deduce them. And these principles are roughly you should be willing to self regulate correctly. You should be willing to do correct social regulation into organismic. You should be willing to act on your models. We have skin in the game. And you should have called rationality, you should be choosing the right course to work on. And so basically these three rational principles call rationality, fiscal prudence or wisdom, social regulation is justice, the correct social one, and the internal regulation is temperance. And there's a willingness to act on your models is correct. Mm hmm. And then he says that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues, three divine virtues, and these divine virtues cannot be deduced. But they reveal themselves by the harmony, which means if you assume them and you extrapolate what's going to happen, you will see that that makes sense. And it's often been misunderstood, as God has to tell you that these are the things. So they're basically there's something nefarious going on. The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe some guy with a long beard that they discovered this. But, uh, so these principles are relatively simple. Again, you need it for high level organization, for the resulting civilization that you form a commitment to unity. So basically, you serve this higher, larger thing, this structural principle on the next level. And he calls that faith. Then there needs to be a commitment to a shared purpose, basically this global reward that you try to figure out what that would be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love. The commitment to a shared purpose is the core of love. Right. You see the sacred thing that is more important than your own organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together and this is how you see the sacred and the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing to act on that principle without getting rewards in the here and now because it doesn't exist yet. Then you start out building the civilization. Right. So you need to be able to do this in the absence of its actual existence yet so it can come into being. So, yeah. So the way comes into being is by you accepting those notions and then you see these three divine concepts and you see them realized that the divine is a loaded concept in our world because we are outside of this card and we are still scarred from breaking free of it. But the idea is basically we need to have a civilization that acts as an international agent, like an insect state. And we are not actually a tribal species. We are state building species. And was what enabled state building is basically the formation of religious states and other forms of rule-based administration in which the individual doesn't matter as much as the rule or the higher goal. Right. We got there via the question, what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think that Casassa Catholicism is the optimal form of governance because it's obviously on the way out. Right. So it is for the present type of society that we are in. Religious institutions don't seem to be optimal to organize it. So what we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy. And democracy is the rule of oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production that is administered not by the oligarchs themselves, because they there's too much disruption. Right. There's so much innovation that we have in every generation means of production that we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so. And something other takes a leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions and these institutions themselves are not elected, but they provide continuity and they are led by electable politicians. And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to kill people. Right. So you can tell, for instance, of a change in government. If people think that the current government is too corrupt or is not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a journalist finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution is has no plan B like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is what when you run a society by the deep state. So ideally you have an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens. Right. So you will have a continuity and the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in in the West. And the way it's set up in the US is largely a result of low level models. It's mostly just second third order consequences that people are modeling and the design of these institutions. It's a relatively young society that doesn't really take care of the downstream effects of many of the decisions that are being made. And I suspect that I can help with this in a way, if you can fix the incentives to the society of the US as a society of cheaters, it's basically cheating, so indistinguishable from innovation. And we want to encourage innovation and elaborate on what you mean by cheating. It's basically people to things that they know are wrong. It's acceptable to do things that you know are wrong in this society to a certain degree. You can, for instance, suggests an unsustainable business models and implement them. Right. But you're always pushing the boundaries. I mean, yes, you're yes. Does is seen as a good thing, largely. Yes, and this is different from other societies, so, for instance, social mobility is an aspect of this, social mobility is the result of individual innovation that would not be sustainable at scale for everybody else. Right. Normally, you should not go up. You should go deep. Right. We need bakers need to be very, very good bakers. But in a society that innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really good machine. Right. And that's not a bad thing. And it's a thing that made us so successful. Right. But it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability, but for innovation. And so it's not obvious as the evolutionary process is unrolling, it's not obvious that that long term would be better, but it has side effects. So basically, if you cheat, you will have a certain layer of toxic sludge that covers everything that is a result of cheating. And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging that the system is horrible or the benefits actually outweigh the the the negative effects. How do we get to the system of government as best that was from. I'm trying to trace back the last five minutes, I suspect that we can find a way back to I thinking about the way in which our brain has to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons and our mind is a society of behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that implements regulation. And government is social regulation. We often see government as the manifestation of power or local interests, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the conditions of human survival. And this platform emerges or the current needs and possibilities and the trajectory that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options on how we can move into the next stage without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly agree that it's a bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a while and the entire infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions and they are not that many natural transitions available at any given point. What are you, a natural transition? So we try to not to have revolutions if we can it. Right. So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems in the mind, he also said that you said that in some sense, becoming an adult means you take charge of your emotions. Maybe never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind, what's the role of emotion and what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role? It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling. And in common parlance, we don't think that emotion is a configuration of the cognitive system. And that's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state. So when you have an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal, valence, your attentional focus, whether it's right or narrow into reception or extra reception and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way. You relate with the environment and to yourself. And this is in some sense an emotional configuration. And the more narrow sense and emotion is an effective state. It has an object and the relevance of that object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated with rewards, things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs. You act on models of your needs, because when the pleasure and pain manifest, it's too late. You've done everything but so you act on expectations. What? We'll give you a pleasure and pain. And these are your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy. They just coexist and compete. And your organism has the human brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purpose is need to be consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people need to make art and other people make art to eat. They might be end up doing the same things, but they cooperate in very different ways because the ultimate goals are different and we cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything else it is not cooperation on shared purpose is transactional. I don't think I understood that last piece of the achieving the homeostasis. Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion? Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling and in the sense what you feel is an appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based on your motivation. Yes. And on your estimates, not your part of the subconscious geometric parts of your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network. And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind, to your conscious attention by mapping the most features into a space. So what you will feel about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your solar plexus and you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Right. Your body remembers the space that is always instantiated, always available. So it's a very obvious target. If you're not in the symbolic parts of your brain, try to talk to you, symbolic parts of your brain to map the feelings into the body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant or unpleasant, depending on whether the appraisal has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different features of them that give you more knowledge about the nature of what your feelings are. For instance, when you feel connected to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around your heart, and you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're reaching out. Right. And it's very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's called it. It's encoded. It's a code in which the nonsupport are parts of your mind talked with the symbolic one. And then the expression of emotion is then the final step that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. That's just part of this case, probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they are in, others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state. So we now look at the inflections that the difference between the standard face that they're going to make in this situation. When you were at a funeral, everybody expects you to make a solemn face, but the solemn face doesn't express whether your said or not. It just expresses that you understand what face you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you are triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta between a sad, truly sad expression and the things that are animated meeting this face behind the curtain. So the interesting thing as so having done this, having done this podcast and the video component, one of the things I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I, I just don't know how to express emotion on my face when I see that as weakness. But whatever the people look to me after you say something, they look to my face to to help them see how they should feel about what he said, which is fascinating, because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did you particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting it makes me cognizant of I'm part like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things, but I'm part of the play that you're the key actor. And by making my facial expressions and then and therefore telling the narrative of what the big like the big point is, which is fascinating. And I'm supposed to be making facial expressions, even this conversation is hard because my preference would be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen. Yes. Which is I understand this because it's intrusive to interact with others this way. And basically Eastern European society have a taboo against that, and especially Russia. And the further you go to the east and in the south, it's the opposite. You're expected to be hyper animated in your face and you also expect it to show positive effect. Yes. And if you saw positive effect without a good reason in Russia, people will think you are stupid, unsophisticated person. Exactly. And here, positive effect without reason goes either appreciate or goes unnoticed. No, it's the default. It's being expected. Everything is amazing. Have you seen this Lego Movie? No. There was a diagram where somebody gave the appraisals that exist in the US and Russia. So you have your birth curve and the lower 10 percent in us. Yeah. Ah, it's a good start. Everything about the lowest 10 percent is. It's amazing. It's amazing. And for Russians, everything below the top 10 percent, it's terrible. And everything except the top percent is I don't like it in the top percent. It's even so, you know, it's funny, but it's kind of true. No. Yeah, but there's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how you construct meaning in the US. Usually you focus on the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative aspects. And in our Eastern European traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something above the waterline, you also need to put something below the waterline because existence by itself is best neutral. Right? That's the basic intuition at best. Neutral. Yes. Or just suffering the default. There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty are inextricably linked to the reality of suffering. And to not acknowledge the reality of suffering means that you are really stupid and unaware of the fact that basically every conscious being spent most of the time suffering. Yeah, you just summarized the ethos of the Eastern Europe. Yeah, most of life is suffering with occasional moments of beauty. And if your facial expressions don't acknowledge the abundance of suffering in the world and the existence itself, then you must be an idiot. It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the U.S. and you in some sense preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that are embedded in your own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel the mermaid. Yeah. And I asked you, why are you not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. Siren sirens In people, you don't play with your food. It does not end well. And then you tell her the original story, which is not the one by Andreassen, which is the romantic one. And there's a much darker. One, which has been a story, what happened so when Dean is a mermaid or a what a woman, she lives on the ground of a river and she meets this prince and they fall in love. And the prince really, really wants to be with her. And she says, OK, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman if you marry somebody else, even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe. And the water and I have other things to do than managing your kingdom as you have here. You will die. And eventually, after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her and she shows up and quietly goes into his chamber. And nobody is able to stop her or willing to do so because is fierce. And she comes quietly and said out of his chamber and they ask her what has happened, what did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death. All done. And you know, the Anderson story, right in the innocent story, the mermaid is playing with this prince that she saves and she falls up with him and she cannot live out there. So she is giving up her voice and her tail for a human like appearance so she can walk among the humans. But this guy does not recognize that she is the one that you marry. Instead, he marries somebody who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his own kingdom and so on, as he should. Quite tragic. And she dies. Yeah. So yeah. Instead, Disney, The Little Mermaid story has a little bit of a happy ending. That's the Western. That's the American way. And my own problem is this. This, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other thing. So I am indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You sacrifice your life for romantic love. That's what you do. Because if you are confronted with either serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing and the economic and social and or other human incentives, that's wrong. You should follow your heart. So do you think suffering is fundamental to happiness along these lines, suffering as the result of caring about things that you cannot change? And if you are able to change what you care about to those things that you can change, you will not suffer. But would then would you then be able to experience happiness? Yes, but happiness itself is not important. Happiness is like a cookie when you are a child. Using cookies are very important and you want to have all the cookies in the world. You look forward to being an adult because then you have as many cookies as you want, right? Yes. But as an adult, you realize the cookie is a tool. It's a tool to make you eat vegetables. And once you eat your vegetables anyway, you stop eating cookies for the most part, because otherwise you will get diabetes and will not be around for your kids. Yes, but then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie, if scarcity is enforced. Nevertheless, the pleasure comes from the scarcity. Yes, but the happiness is a cookie that your brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the Environment Department cannot make you happy. It's your appraisal of the environment that makes you happy. And if you can change the appraisal of the environment, which you can learn to, then you can create arbitrary dates for happiness. And some meditators fall into this trap so they discover the room, the basement room in their brain where the cookies are made and they indulge and stuff themselves. And after a few months, it gets really old. And the big crisis of meaning comes because they thought before that their unhappiness was the result of not being happy enough so that they can release the neurotransmitters at well, if they train. And then the crisis of meaning pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is, why do I love how can I make a sustainable civilization that is meaningful to me? OK, and insert myself into this. And this was the problem that you couldn't solve in the first place. But at the end of all this, let me then ask that same question, what is the answer to that? What could possibly answer be the meaning of life? What what could an answer be? What is it to you? I think that if you look at the meaning of life, you look at what the cell is. The life is the cell. Cell. Yes. Or this principle, the cell. It's this self organizing thing that can participate in evolution in order to make it work. It's a molecular machine. It needs a set of replicator and entropy extractor and a Turing machine. If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell and it is not living right. And life is basically the emergent complexity or that principle. Once you have this intelligent super molecule, the cell is very little that you cannot make it to. It's probably the optimal computer in your mind, especially in terms of resilience. It's very hard to sterilize the planet once it's infected with life. So its active function of these three components or the super cell or cell is is present in the cell is present in us. And it's just the are just an expression of the cell, the third layer of complexity and the organization of cells that. So in a way, it's tempting to think of the cell as a volume on prop. If you want to build intelligence on other planets, the best way to do this is to infect them for cells and wait for long enough. And there's a reasonable chance the stuff is going to evolve into an information processing principle that is general enough to become sentient with. That idea is very akin to sort of the the same dream and beautiful ideas that are expressed, the cellular automata in their most simple mathematical form. If you just inject the system with some basic mechanisms of replication. So on basic rules, amazing things would emerge at the cell is able to do something that James Hardie calls existential design. He points out that in technical design, because from the outside in, we work in highly controlled environment in which everything is deterministic like our computers, our laps or our engineering workshops. And then we use this determinism to implement a particular kind of function that we dream up and that seamlessly interfaces with all the other deterministic functions that we already have in our world. So it's basically from the outside in and the logical systems design from the inside out as seat will come a seedling by taking some of the relatively unorganized matter around it and turn it into its own structure and thereby subdue the environment. And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells having a similar organization that is already compatible. But unless that's that's there, there needs to divide to create a structure by itself. Right. So it's the self organizing principle that works on a somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in the sense is to produce complexity. And the complexity allows you to harvest entropy gradients that you couldn't harvest without the complexity. And in the sense intelligent and life are very strongly connected because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control and the conditions of complexity. So basically, you shift the boundary between the altered systems into the realm of the of chaos. You build bridgeheads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we are doing. This is not necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have prioress for that we have lost for outside of the Prius, there is no meaning. Meaning only exists if a mind protects it, right? Yeah, that is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is to try to build and maintain a sustainable civilization and taken a step outside of that. We talked about a man with a beard and God. But something. Some mechanism perhaps must have planted the seed, the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God? And what would that look like, though, if there was no spontaneous abiogenesis in the sense that the first cell formed by some happy random accidents where the molecules just happen to be in the right consolation to each other. But there could also be the mechanism of that allows for the random I mean, is like turtles all the way down. There seems to be there has to be a head turtle at the bottom or something really wild. Imagine. Is it possible that a gas giant could become intelligent, but would that involve. So imagine that you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on the gas giants like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these swarm systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something. And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds and thereby produce some self stabilising patterns that eventually lead to regulation, feedback loops, nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such this thing that basically has emergent, self-sustaining self organizing complexity. And at some point this wakes up and realizes and basically lems Solaris. I am a thinking planet. Yes, but it will not replicate because I cannot recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence that has spontaneously formed because it could and now it builds upon and probe. And the best for Noaman purpose I think might be the self. So maybe it will because it's very, very clever and very enduring, create cells and sends them out and one of them has infected our planet. I'm not suggesting that is the case, but it would be compatible with the Birmingham hypothesis. And it was my intuition that abiogenesis is very unlikely. It's possible, but you probably need to draw the cosmic dice very often, maybe more often than the other planetary surfaces. I don't know. So God is just a large enough a system that's large enough that allows randomness? No, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation. I think it's a mistranslation of the time into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is actually the childhood memories of a God. So when then say that Genesis is the childhood memories of a God, it's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being. And we typically interpret Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being. Yes. And I think when you read it, there is light and darkness that has been created and then you discover sky and ground create them. You construct the plants and the animals and you give everything that their names and so on. That's basic cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that every mind has to go through. Then it makes sense of the world. And then you have children. You can see how initially they distinguish light and darkness and then they make out directions in it and they discover sky and ground and they discover the plants and the animals and they give everything their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind because it's not given right. Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns on your retina. Also, if there was some big nerd to set up a server and runs this world on it, this would not create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not have the magical power to give meaning to our existence. Right. So this equation of a creator, God with the God of meaning is laid off and you shouldn't do it. The other one that is done in Catholicism is the equation of the first mover, the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton that runs the universe. Title says if things are moving and things seem to be moving here, something must move them, right? If something moves them, something must move the thing that is moving. So there must be a prime mover in this idea. To say that this prime mover is a supernatural being is complete nonsense, right? It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we have to explain the enormity that this automaton exists at all. But again, we don't have any possibility for anything about its properties except that it's able to produce change and information. So there needs to be some kind of computational principle. This is all there is. But to say this automaton is identical again with the creator of first class or with the thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion. Now, I think that what we perceive is the higher being that we are part of and the higher being that we are part of is the civilisation. It's the thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell has to our body. And we have this prior because we have evolved to organize in these structures. So basically the Christian God in its natural form, without the mythology, if you address it, is basically the platonic form of the civilisation. Is the is the ideal? Yes, it's this idea that you try to approximate when you interact with others, not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right. While we covered a lot of ground and we left with one of my favorite lines and there's many, which is happiness is a cookie that brain bakes itself. It's been a huge honor. And a pleasure to talk to you. I'm sure our past across many times again. Josh, thank you so much for talking today. Thank you so much fun. I enjoyed it. Awesome.

#117 – Sheldon Solomon: Death and Meaning, The following is a conversation with Sheldon Solomon, social psychologist, a philosopher called developer of terror management theory and co-author of The Warm at the Core on the role of death in life. He further carried the ideas of Ernest Becker that can crudely summarize the idea that our fear of death is at the core of the human condition and the driver of most of the creations of human civilization. Quick summary of the sponsors Blankest Express, VPN and Kashyap. Click the links in the description to get a discount. It really is the best way to support this podcast. Let me say as a side note that Ernest Becker's book, Denial of Death, had a big impact on my thinking about human cognition, consciousness and the deep ocean currents of our mind that are behind the surface behaviors we observe. Many people have told me that they think about death or don't think about death, fear, death, or don't fear death. But I think not many people think about this topic deeply, rigorously in the way that Nietzsche suggested this topic. Like many that lead to deep personal self reflection, frankly, is dangerous for the mind as all first principles. Thinking about the human condition is, if you gaze long into the abyss, like Nietzsche said, the abyss will gaze back into you. I've been recently reading a lot about World War two, Stalin and Hitler. It feels to me that there's some fundamental truth there to be discovered in the moments of history that changed everything, the suffering, the triumphs. If I bring up Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin in these conversations, it is never through a political lens. I'm not left nor right. I think for myself deeply and often question everything changing my mind as often as is needed. I ask for your patience, empathy and rigorous thinking. If you arrive to this podcast from a place of partisanship, if you hate Trump or love Trump or any other political leader, no matter what he or they do, and see everyone who disagrees with you as delusional, I ask that you unsubscribe and don't listen to these conversations, because my hope is to go beyond that kind of divisive thinking. I think we can only make progress toward truth through deep and pathetic thinking and conversation and is always love.

What is the role of death and fear of death and life? Well, from our perspective, the uniquely human awareness of death and. Our unwillingness to accept that fact, we would argue, is the primary motivational impetus for almost everything that people do, whether they're aware of it or not. So that's kind of been your life work, your view of the human condition. Is that death you've in the book worm at the core, that death is at the core of our consciousness, of everything, of how we see the world, of what drives us. And we can you can you elaborate? Like what? How you see death fitting in? What does it mean to be at the core of our being? So I think that's a great question. And, you know, to be pedantic, I usually start, you know, my psychology class and I say to the students, OK, you know, let's define our terms and ology part. They get right away. You know, it's the study of and then we get to the psyche part. And understandably, you know, the students are like, oh, that means mind. And I'm like, well, no, that's a modern interpretation. But in ancient Greek, it means soul, but not in the Cartesian dualistic sense that most of us in the West think when that word comes to mind. And so you hear the word soul and you're like, well, all right, that's the non-physical part of me that's potentially detachable from my corporal container when I'm no longer here. But Aristotle's who coined the word psyche, I think he was not a dualist. He was a modernist. He thought that the soul was inextricably connected to the body and he defined soul as the essence of a natural body that is alive. And then he goes on and he says, All right, but let me give you an example. If if. An axe was alive, the soul of an axe would be to chop and you can pluck your eyeball out of your head and it was still functioning. Then the soul of the eyeball would be to see, you know, and then it's like, alright. The soul of a grasshopper is to hop the soul of a woodpecker pack. Which raises the question, of course, what is the essence of what it means to be human? And here, of course, there is no one. Universally accepted conception of the essence of our humanity. All right, Aristotle, you know, gives us the idea of humans as rational animals. You know, we're Homo sapiens, but not the only game in town. Got Joseph Hoisin, you're an anthropologist in the 20th century. He called us homo glutens that were basically fundamentally playful creatures. And I think it was Hannah. Our Rent Homo Faber were toolmaking creatures. Another woman, Ellen Dissanayake, wrote a book called Homo Aesthetics and following Aristotle and his poetic, she's like, well, we're not only rational animals, we're also aesthetic creatures that appreciate beauty. There's another take on humans. I think they call us homo narratives. We're all we're storytelling creatures. And I think all of those designations of what it means to be human are quite useful, heuristically, and certainly worthy of our collective cogitation. But what what garnered my attention when I was a young punk was just a single line in an essay by a Scottish guy who was Alexander Smith. And in a book called Dream Pailthorpe, I think it's written in the eighteen sixties. He just says right in the middle of an essay, it is our knowledge that we have to die that makes us human. And I remember reading that and in my gut I was like, Oh man, I don't like that, but I think you're on to something. And then William James, the great Harvard philosopher and arguably the first academic psychologist he referred to as the worm at the core of the human condition. So that's where the worm at the core idea comes in. And that's just an allusion to the story of Genesis back in the proverbial old days in the Garden of Eden, everything was going tremendously well. And so the serpent tempts Eve to take a chomp out of the apple of the Tree of Knowledge. And Adam partakes also, and this is according to the Bible, what brings death into the world. And from our vantage point, the story of Genesis is a remarkable allegorical recount of the origin of consciousness, where we get to the point where, by virtue of our vast intelligence, we come to realize the inevitability of death. And so, you know, the apple is beautiful and it's tasty. But when you get right into the middle of it, there's that ugly reality, which is our finitude. And then fast forward a bit. And I was a young professor at Skidmore College in 1980. My Ph.D. is an experimental social psychology, and I mainly did studies with clinical psychologists evaluating the efficacy of non pharmacological interventions to reduce stress. And that was good work. And I found it interesting. But in my first week as a professor at Skidmore, I just walking up and down the shelves of the library, saw some books by a guy I had never heard of, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist, recently deceased. He died in 1974 after weeks before actually he was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction for his book The Denial of Death. And that was his last book. It's actually his next to last book. I don't know how you pulled this off, but he had one more after he died called Escape from Evil. And evidently it was supposed to originally the denial of death was supposed to be this giant thousand page book that was both. And they split it up. And the what became escape from evil. His wife, Marie Becker, finished. Well, be that as it may in it is in the denial of death, where Becker just says in the first paragraph, I believe that the terror of death and the way that human beings respond to it or decline to respond to it is primarily responsible for almost everything we do, whether we're aware of it or not, and mostly we're not. And so I read that first paragraph, Lex, and I was like, wow, OK, this dude, you're onto something, you're on to something. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. And then. It reminded me, I think, not to play psychologist, but, you know, let's face it, I believe there's a reason why we end up drifting where we ultimately come to. So I'm in my mid 20s. I got the inspectors book in my hand. And the next thing I know I'm remembering when I'm eight years old, the day that my grandmother died and, you know, the day before my mom said, oh, say goodbye to grandma. She's not well. And look, I so I was like, OK, Grandma. And I knew she wasn't well, but I didn't really appreciate the magnitude of her illness. Well, she dies the next day and it's in the evening. And I'm just sitting there looking at my stamp collection and I'm like, wow, I'm going to miss my grandmother. And then I'm like, no, wait a minute. That means my mother's going to die. And after she gets old and that's even worse. After all, who's going to make me dinner and not bother me for a while? But then I'm looking at the stamps, all the dead American presidents. And I'm like, there's George Washington. He's dead. There's Thomas Jefferson, he's dead. My mom's going to be dead. Oh, I'm going to get old and be dead some day. And at eight years old, that was my first explicit existential crisis. I remember it being, you know, one of these blood curdling realizations that I tried my best to ignore for the most of the time. I was subsequently growing up. But fast forward back to Skidmore College, mid 20s, you know, reading Becker's book in the nineteen eighties, thinking to myself, wow, one of the reasons why I'm finding this so compelling is that it squares with my own personal experience and then to make a short story long and I'll shut up. But what what grabbed me about Bucker and this is in part because I read a lot of his other books. There's another book, The Birth and Death of Meaning, which is framed in from an evolutionary perspective. And then the denial of death is really more framed from an existential psychodynamic vantage point. And as a young academic, I was really taken by what I found to be a very potent juxtaposition that you really don't see that often yet. Usually evolutionary types are eager to dismiss the psychodynamic types and vice versa. And maybe only John Bowlby. You know, there's there's other folks, but the attachment theorist John Bowlby was really one of the first serious academics to say these these ways of thinking about things are quite compatible. And can you comment on what's what is psychodynamics view of the world is versus an evolutionary view of the world just in case people are not? Yeah, absolutely. That's that's a fine question. Well, for the evolutionary types in general are interested in how it is and why it is that we have adapted to our surroundings in the service of persisting over time and being represented in the gene pool thereafter. Used to be a fish. Yeah, we used to be a fish. And yeah, I'll end up talking on a podcast how we came to be that way, how we came to be that way. And so whereas the existential psychodynamic types I would say are more interested in development across a single lifespan and. But, but the evolutionary types dismiss the psychodynamic types as overly speculative and devoid of empirical support for their views. They you know, they'll just say these guys are talking shit, if you'll pardon the expression. And of course, you can turn right around and say the same about the evolutionary types that they are often and rightfully criticized the evolutionary psychologists for water called the just so stories. But where it's like, oh, this is probably why Fill in the blank is potentially adaptive. And my thought again early on was I didn't see any intrinsic antifascists between these viewpoints. So I just found them dialectically compatible and very. Powerful when combined, so one question I would ask is about a science being speculative, you know, we understand so little about the human mind. You said you picked up this book and, you know, it felt like he was onto something. That's the same thing I felt when I picked up Becker's book, probably also in my early 20s. You know, I read a lot of philosophy, but it felt like the question of the meaning of life kind of. You know, this seemed to be the most the closest to the truth. Somehow it was onto something. So I guess the question I want to ask also is like how speculative a psychology how like all of your life's work, how do you feel? How confident do you feel about the whole thing, about understanding our mind? I feel confident. We aren't confident to have it both ways. Like, what do we make of psychology want to make starting with Freud, you know, starting just just ah, or even just philosophy, even the aspects of the sciences, like, you know, my field of artificial intelligence, but also physics, you know, it often feels like and we don't really understand most of what's going on here. And certainly that's true with the human mind. Yeah. Well, to me, that's the proper epistemological stance. I don't know anything. Well, it's the Socratic. I know that. I don't know which is the first step on the path to wisdom. I would argue forcefully that we know a lot more. Then we used to, I would argue, equally forcefully, not that I have a Ph.D. in philosophy or science, but I believe that that Thomas Kunz of the world are right when they point out that change is not necessarily progress. And so on the one hand, I do think we know a lot more than we did back in the day when if you wanted to fly, you put on some wax wings and jumped off a mountain. On the other hand, I think it's quite arrogant when scientists all just speak about psychological scientists, when they have the audacity to mistake statistical precision for knowledge and insight, and when they make the mistake, in my estimation, that Einstein bemoaned. And that's this idea that the mere accumulation of data will necessarily result in conceptual breakthroughs. And so I like the what we're all hope appreciative of the people who trained us. But I remember my first day in graduate school at the University of Kansas. They brought us into a room. And on one side of the board was a quote by Kurt Lewin or within famous German social psychologist and was nothing. Then the quote is, there's nothing more useful than a good theory. And then on the other side was another quote by German physicist whose name eludes me. And it was All theories are wrong. And I'm like. Which is it and of course, the point is that it's both our theories are, I believe, powerful ways to direct our attention to aspects of human affairs that might render us better able to understand ourselves in the world around us. Now, I also, as an experimental psychologist, I adhere to the view that theories are essentially hypothesis generating devices and that at its best, science is a dialectical interplay where you have theoretical assertions that yield testable hypotheses and that either results in the corroboration of the theory, the rejection of it or the modification thereafter. If we look at the existentialists or even like modern philosophers, psychologists, types like Jordan Peerson, I'm not sure if you're familiar with I know Jordan pretty well. We go way back. Actually, if he were here with us today, we would he would be jumping in and I believe very interesting and important ways. But yeah, we go back 30 years ago, he was basically saying our work is nonsense. Let's get into this. I'll talk to Jordan eventually. And this thing got to some rough times right now. Oh, absolutely. And I and I wish him well. Jordan was working on his maps of meaning and we were publishing our work. And I think Jordan at the time was concerned about our vague claims to the effect that all meaning is arbitrary. He takes more youngin as well as evolutionary view that I don't think is wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings that are more important, let's say, religious types, and that we didn't pay sufficient attention to that in our early days. So can you try to elucidate, like, what his worldview is because he's also a religious man. So what what was this was some of the interesting aspects of the disagreements that they went back in the day. I just said, you know, Jordan was a young punk. We were young punks. He was just kind of flailing in an animated way at some conferences saying that we still both kind of punks. Yeah, we kind of punks. I saw him three or four years ago. We spoke on I was an awesome day. We in Canada at the Ontario Shakespeare Festival, where we were asked to be on a Canadian broadcast system program. I think we were talking about Macbeth from a psychodynamic perspective, and I hadn't seen him and a ton of years and we spent two days together, had a great time. You know, we had just written our book, The Worm at the Core. And he's like, you know, you're you're missing a big opportunity. Every time you say something, you have to have your phone and you have to film yourself and then you have to put it on YouTube. Yeah, he was onto something that, you know, just as a small tangent. Yeah. It's it's almost sad to look at Jordan Peterson, somebody like yourself. After having done this podcast, I've realized that there is really brilliant people in this world and oftentimes, especially like when they're I mean, it would love a little bit like punks. That's right. They kind of do their own thing and the world doesn't know they exist as much as they should. And it's so interesting because most people are kind of. Boring. And then the interesting ones kind of go on their own and there's not a smartphone. That's so interesting. He was onto something that I mean, it's interesting that he I don't think he was thinking from a money perspective, but he was probably thinking of, like, connecting with people or sharing his knowledge. But people don't often think that way. That's right. So maybe we can try to get back to you both brilliant people. And I would love to get some interesting disagreements earlier and later about in your psychological work in your world is. Well, our disagreements today would be along two dimensions. One is he is then again, I wish he was here to correct me. Yes. When I say that he is more committed to the virtues of the Judeo-Christian tradition, particularly Christianity, and in a sense is contemporary Kierkegaard of sorts, when he's saying there's only one way to leap into faith. And I would take issue with that claim on the grounds that that is one, but by no means, not the only way to find meaning and value in life. And so when I see his what's his warm at the core? What is it we're talking about? A little bit of a higher level of discovering meaning. Yeah. What's his what does he make of death? Oh, I don't know. And this is where it would be nice to have him here. He has, you know, from a distance criticized our work as misguided. Having said that, though, when we were together, he said something along the lines that there is no theoretical body of work in academic psychology right now for which there is more empirical evidence. And so I appreciated that. He's a great researcher. He's a good clinician. The other thing that we will agree to disagree about rather vociferously is ultimately political slash economics. So I remember being at dinner with him, telling him that the next book that I wanted to write was going to be called Why Left and Right are both beside the Point. And my argument was going to be and it is going to be that both liberal and political, not liberal and conservative political philosophy, are each intellectually and morally bankrupt because they're both framed in terms of assumptions about human nature that are demonstrably false. And Jordan didn't mind me knocking liberal political philosophy on those grounds. That would basically be like Steven Pinker's blank slate. But he took issue when I pointed out that actually it's conservative political philosophy, which starts with John Locke's assumption that in a state of nature, there are no societies, just autonomous individuals who are striving for survival. That's one of the most obviously patently wrong assertions in the history of intellectual thought. And Locke uses that to justify his claims about the individual right to acquire unlimited amounts of property, which is ultimately the justification for neo liberal economics. And Kielinger, a little bit. What's the. Can you describe his philosophy and his view of the world? Sure. And what neo liberal economics is? Yeah. Let me translate in English. So basically on all these days, anybody who says I'm a I'm a conservative free market type, you're following John Locke and Adam Smith, whether you're aware of it or not. So here's John Locke, who, by the way, all of these guys are great. So for me to appear to criticize any of these folks, it is with the highest regard. And also we need to understand, in my estimation, how important their ideas are. Locke is working in a time where all rule was top down by divine right. And he's trying desperately to come up with a philosophical justification to shift power and order. Autonomy to individuals, and he starts in his second treatise on government, 16, 90 or so he teaches. He says, OK, let's start with a state of nature. And he's like in a state of nature, there's no societies, there's just individuals. And in a perfect universe, there wouldn't be any societies. There would just be individuals who, by the law of nature, have a right to survive. And in the service of survival, they have the right to acquire and preserve the fruits of their own labor. But his point is and it's actually a good one, you know, he's following hobs here. He's like, well, the problem with that is that people are assholes. And if they would let each other alone, then we would still be living in a state of nature. Everybody just doing what they did to get by each day. But it's a whole lot easier, you know, if I see like an apple tree a mile away. Well, I can go over and pick an apple. But if you're 10 meters away with an apple in your hand, it's a lot easier if I pick up a rock and crack your head and take the apple. And his point was that the problem is that people can't be counted on to behave. They will they will take each other's property. Moreover. He argued, if someone takes your property, you have the right to you have the right to retribution in proportion to the degree of the magnitude of the transgression. English translation If I take your apple, you have the right to take an apple back. You don't have the right to kill my first born. But people being people, they're apt to escalate retaliatory behavior, thus creating what Locke called a state of war. So he said in order to avoid a state of war, people reluctantly give up their freedom in exchange for security. They agree to obey the law. And not the sole function of government is to keep domestic tranquility and to ward off foreign invasion in order to protect our right to property rights. So now here's the property thing. All right. So Locke says if you look in the Bible and in nature, there is no private property and. But WLOX says, well, surely if there's anything that you own, it's your body and surely you have a right by nature to stay alive and then by extension, anything that you do where you exert effort or labor that becomes your private property. So back to the apple tree. If I walk over to an apple tree, that's everybody's apples until I pick one. And the minute I do, that is my apple. And then he says, you can have as many apples as you want as long as you don't waste them and as long as you don't impinge on somebody else's right to get apples. All right. So far, so good. Yeah. And then he says, well, OK. In the early days. You could only eat so many apples or you could only trade so many apples with somebody else, so he was like, well, if you put a fence around a bunch of apple trees, those become your apples. That's your property. If somebody else wants to put a fence around Nebraska, that's their property. And everybody can have as much property as they want because the world is so big that there is no limit to what you can have if you pursue it by virtue of your own effort. But then he says money came into the picture. And this is important because it's a he noticed long before anybody before the Freud's of the world that money is funky because it has no intrinsic value. He's like, look at that shiny piece of metal that actually has if you're hungry and you have a choice between a carrot and a lump of gold in the desert, most people are going to go for the carrot. But his point is, is that the allure of money is that it's basically a concentrated symbol of wealth. But because it doesn't spoil, Locke said, you're entitled to have as much money as you're able to garner. Right. Then he says, well, the reality is, is that some people are more the word that he used was industrious, he said, some people more industrious than others. All right. Today we would say smarter, less lazy, more ambitious. He just said that's natural. It's also true. Therefore, he argued over time, some people are going to have a whole lot of property and other people, not much at all. Inequality for Locke is natural and beneficial for everyone. His argument was that, you know, the rising tide lifts all boats and that the truly creative and innovative are entitled to relatively unlimited worth because we're all better off as a result. So the point very simply is that, well, that's based. And then you have Adam Smith, you know, in the next century with the invisible hand where Adam Smith says everyone pursuing their own selfish, that's not necessarily pejorative. If everyone pursues their own selfish interests, we will all be better off as a result. And what do you think is the flaw in that way? Well, there's two flaws. One is, is that well, one flaw is, first of all, that that it is based on an erroneous assumption to begin with, which is that there never was a time in human history when we were in a social species. In a sense, you don't feel like that. There's this emphasis of individual autonomy is a flawed premise. Like there's a there's something fundamentally, deeply interconnected between us. I do. I think that Plato and Socrates, you know, in the Credo were closer to the truth when they started with the assumption that we were interdependent and they derived individual autonomy as a manifestation of a functional social system. That's fascinating. So when Margaret Thatcher you're too young, you know, in the 1980s, she said societies, there's no such thing as societies. There's just individuals pursuing their self-interest. So so that's one point where I would take issue respectfully with John Locke. Point number two is when Locke says in sixteen ninety while England's filled up. So if you want some land, just go to America, it's empty. Or maybe there's a few savages there, just kill them. So. And Melville does the same thing in Moby Dick where he he thinks about will there ever come a time where we run out of whales? And he says no, but we have run out of whales. And so Locke was right, maybe in 16, 90, that the world was large and had infinite resources. He's certainly wrong today. And in my opinion, also wrong is the claim that the unlimited pursuit of personal wealth does not harm those around us. There is no doubt. That radical inequality is tragic psychologically and physically, it's poverty is not that terrible, it's easy for me to say because I have a place to stay and something to eat, but as long as you're not starving and have a place to be. Poverty is not as challenging as being having the impoverished in close proximity to those who are obscenely wealthy. So it's not the absolute measure of your well-being as the inequality of that well being brought into painful. So maybe just linger on the Jordan Peterson thing in terms of your disagreement as well. As you see, he went through quite a bit. You know, there's been quite a bit of fire right in in his defense or maybe his opposition to the idea of equality of outcomes. So looking at the inequality that's in our world, looking at, you know, certain groups measurably having an outcome that's different than other groups and then drawing conclusions about fundamental unfairness, injustice, inequality in the system. So like systematic racism, systematic sexism, systematic, anything else that creates inequality. And he's been kind of saying pretty simple things to say that, you know, the system for the most part is not broken or flawed. Yeah. That the inequalities part, the the inequality of outcomes is part of our world. What we should strive for is the, you know, equality of opportunity. Yeah. And I do not dispute that as an abstraction. But again, to back up for a second, I do take issue with Jordan's fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal of Marxist ideas, which he has, in my estimation, mischaracterized in his public depictions. Let's get into so he seems to really not like socialism, Marxism, communism, historically speaking. Sort of. I mean, how would I characterize it? I'm not exactly sure. I don't want to again, he will eventually be here to defend himself. John Locke, unfortunately not here to defend. Exactly. But what was your sense about Marxism and and the the way Jordan talks about the way you think about it from the economics, from the philosophical perspective? Yeah. If we were all here together, I'd say we need to start with Marxist economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 before Marx became more of a polemicist. And I would argue that Marxist political philosophy, his crappy economist, I don't dispute that. But his arguments about human nature, his arguments about the inevitably catastrophic psychological and environmental and economic effects of capitalism, I would argue every one of those has proven quite right. Marx maybe did not have the answer, but he saw in the 18, whenever he was writing, that inevitably capitalism would lead to massive inequity, that it was ultimately based on the need to denigrate and dehumanize labor, to render them in his language, a fleshy cog in a giant machine. And it would create tension and conflict between those who own things and those who made things that over time would always you know, the Thomas, a guy who writes about capital and just makes the point the return on investment will always be greater than wages. That means the people with money are going to have a lot more. That means there's going to come a point where the economic house of cards falls apart. Now that Joseph Schumpeter's of the world, they're like, that's creative destruction. Bring it that. That's great. So I think it's Niall Ferguson. He was he's a historian. He may be at Stanford now. He was at Harvard. You know, he writes about the history of money and he's like, yeah, there's been 20 or whatever depressions and big recessions in the last several hundred years. And when that happens, half of the pop. Asian or whatever is catastrophically inconvenienced, but that's the price that we pay for progress, other people would argue, and I would agree with them, that I will happily sacrifice the rate of progress in order to flatten the curve of economic destruction, to put that in plain English. I would direct our attention to the social democracies that forgetting for the moment of whether it's possible to do this on a scale in a country as big as ours on all of the things that really matter, you know, gross domestic GDP or whatever, that's just an abstraction. But when you look at whatever the United Nations says, how we measure quality of life, you know, life expectancy, education, you know, rates of alcoholism, suicide and so on, the countries that do better are the mixed economies, their market economies that have high tax rates in exchange for the provision of services. The commas are right for citizens. So, I mean, I guess the question is, you've kind of mentioned that, you know, as Marx described, capitalism with a slippery slope, eventually things go awry and some kind of way. So that's the question is when you have when you implement a system, how does it go wrong? Eventually, you know, you know, eventually we'll all be dead. That's exactly right. No, no, no. That's right. So and then the criticism, I think these days, unfortunately, Marxism as like is a dirty word. I say, unfortunately, because even if you disagree with a philosophy, it should you should like calling somebody a Marxist. You should not be a thing that shuts down all conversation. No, that's right. And the fact is, is I'm sympathetic with Jordan's dismissal of the folks and the talking heads these days who spew Marxist words. To me, it's like fashionable nonsense. Do you know that book that the physicist wrote mocking You're Too Young? So in the 20 or so years, we're all pretty young? Well, yeah, that's right. But I think the reason why you physicists, they wrote a paper just mocking the kind of literary postmodern types you. Oh, yes. Oh, those kinds of. Yeah, yeah. That was just nonsense. And of course it was made the lead article. And you know, my point is Marx wouldn't be a Marxist. So I have read and listened to some of the work of Richard Wolffe. He speaks pretty eloquently about Marxism. I like him. He's one of the only, you know, one of the only people speaking about a lot about Marxism in the way we are now in a serious way in it. And it's sort of saying, you know, what are the flaws of capitalism? Not saying like, yeah, basically sounding very different. People should check out his work. No, it's all this kind of work, this kind of outrage mob culture of sort of demanding equality, equality of outcome. That's not Marxism. It is not Marxism. But he he didn't say that. You know, he literally said eat what it was like, each according to their needs and each according to their abilities or something like that. So the question is the implementation like. Absolutely. Humans are messy. So how does it go wrong? Like it is. There you go. I think brilliant. It's messy. And this gets back to my rant about the book that I want to try. If I don't stroke out, why left and right are both beside the point. Yeah. You know, the people or the conservatives are right when they condemn liberals for being simple minded by assuming that a modification of external conditions will yield changes in human nature. You know you know, again, that's where Marx and Skinner are odd bedfellows. You know, here they are just saying, oh, let's change the surroundings and things will inevitably get better. On the other hand, when conservatives say that people are innately selfish and they use that as the justification for glorifying the unbridled pursuit of wealth, well, they're only half right. Because it turns out that we can be innately selfish, but we are also innately generous and reciprocating creatures. There's remarkable studies. I think they've been done at Yale of, you know, babies, 14 month old babies. If someone hands them a toy and then want something in return, babies before they can walk and talk will reciprocate. All right, fine. If someone if they want a toy, let's say, or a bottle of water, baby wants a bottle of water and I look like I'm trying to give it to the baby, but I drop the bottle so the baby doesn't get what she or he wanted when given a chance to reciprocate. Little babies will reciprocate because they're aware of and are responding to intention. Similarly, if they see somebody behaving unfairly to to someone, they will not help that person in return. So so my point is, is, yeah, we are selfish creatures at times, but we are also simultaneously uba social creatures who are eager to reciprocate. And in fact, we're congenitally prepared to be reciprocating to the point where we will reciprocate on the basis of intentions above and beyond what actually have. So, I mean, your work is on the fundamental role of the fear of mortality in ourselves. How fundamental is this reciprocation, this human connection to others? I think it's really in a yeah, I think because yeah, Batz reciprocate, not by intention, but you know this I'm going hear from Richard Dawkins The Selfish Gene, you know, to I love the early Dawkins. I'm less enamored with the early Beatles. Yeah, no. And again, I say this with great respect. But, you know, Dawkins just points out that, you know, reciprocation is just fundamental. Cooperation is fundamental. You know, it is it's a one sided view of evolutionary takes on things when we see it solely in terms of individual competition. And it's almost from a game theoretic perspective to it's just easier to see the world that way. It's it's easier to I don't know. I mean, you see this in physics. There's a whole field of folks like complexity that kind of embrace the fact that it's all intricately connected mess and it's just very difficult to do anything with that kind of science. But it seems to be much closer to actually representing what the world is like. So like you put it earlier works. It's messy. So left and right, you mentioned you're thinking of maybe actually putting it down on paper or something. Yeah, I would like to, because what I would what I would like to point out again and in admiration of all of the people that I will then try and have the gall to criticise is, look, these are all geniuses like genius Adam Smith, genius when he uses the notion that we're bartering creatures. So he uses that reciprocation idea as the basis of his way of thinking about things. That's not at the core. The martyring is not at the core of human nature. It's not a well, he says it is. He says we're fundamentally bartering creatures. But that doesn't even make sense then, because then how how can we then be autonomous individuals? Well, because we're going to barter with an eye on ourselves. For ourselves. Yeah, but all right. So but back to Adam Smith for a second. Y-axis, like Adam Smith, he's got the invisible hand. And my conservative friends like you need to read his books because he is a big fan of the free market. And this is my other gripe with folks who support just unbridled markets. Adam Smith understood that there was a role for government for two reasons. One is, is that just like lock people are not going to behave with integrity. And he understood that one role of government is to maintain a proverbial, you know, even playing field. And then the other thing Smith said was that there's some things that can't be done well for a profit. And I believe he talked about education and public health and infrastructure as things that are best done by governments because you can't you can make a profit. But that doesn't mean that the institutions themselves will be maximally beneficial. Yes. So I would I'm just eager to engage people by saying, let's start with our most contemporary understanding of human nature, which is that we are both selfish. And tend to cooperate, and we also can be heroically. Helpful to folks in our own tribe and of course, how you define one's tribe becomes critically important. But what some people say is, look, we let what would then be what kind of political institutions and what kind of economic organization. Can we think about to kind of hit that sweet spot and that that would be, in my opinion, how do we maximize individual autonomy in a way that fosters creativity and innovation? And the self-regard that comes from creative expression, while engaging, are more cooperative and reciprocal tendencies in order to come up with a system that is potentially stable over time. Because the other thing about all capital based systems stability is a fundamentally unstable. Yeah, because it's based on infinite growth. And, you know, it's a positive feedback loop to basically infinite growth is only good for malignant cancer cells and compound interest. But otherwise, you know, we want to seek a steady state. And that would be, you know, so when Steven Pinker writes, for example, again, great scholar, but I'm going to disagree when he says the world has never been better and all we need to do is keep making stuff and buying stuff. So your sense is the world is sort of in disagreement with Steven Pinker that the world is. Like facing a potential catastrophic collapse in multiple directions, yes, and the fact that they're certain, like the rate of violence in aggregate is decreasing the death, you know, the quality of life, all those kinds of measures you can plot across centuries, that it's improving. That doesn't capture the fact that our world may be we might destroy ourselves in very painful ways in the in the in the next century. So I'm with Jared Diamond, you know, in the book Collapse, where he points out studying the collapse of major civilizations, that it often happens right after things appear to never have been better. Hmm. And in that regard, I mean, there are more known voices that have taken issue with Dr. Pinker. I'm thinking of John Gray, who's a British philosopher. And here in the States, I don't know where he is these days, but Robert J. Lifton, the psycho historian. Yeah, they're both of my view and which I hope is, by the way, wrong. But me too. Yeah, no doubt. But, you know, between, you know, ongoing ethnic tensions, environmental degradation, economic instability and the fact that, you know, the world has become a petri dish of psychopathology, like what really worries me is the the quiet economic pain that people are going through, the businesses that are closed, dreams that are broken because you can no longer do the things that you've wanted to do. And how I mentioned to you off camera that I've been reading the the rise and fall of the Third Reich and I mean the amount of anger and hatred. And on the flipside of that sort of nationalist pride that can arise from deep economic pain, like what happens with the economic pain is you become bitter, yet you start to find the other, whether it's other European nations that mistreated you, whether it's other groups who mistreated you, it always ends up being the Jews that somehow, somehow or fault here. Yeah, that's what worries me, is where this quiet anger and pain goes in twenty, twenty one, twenty, twenty to twenty thirty. If you look. No, I'm sorry to see the parallel. No, no, no. Rise and fall of the Third Reich. But you know what happens 10, 15 years from now from what's because of the covid pandemic that's happening now. Unless you make a I think it really profoundly important point, you know, back to our work for a better earn us back or rather, you know, his point is, is that the way that we manage existential terror is to embrace culturally constructed belief systems that. Give us a sense that life has meaning, we have value and in the form of self esteem, which we get from perceiving that we meet or exceed the expectations associated with the role that we play in society. Well, here we are right now. And in a world where, first of all, if you have nothing, you are nothing. And secondly, as you were saying before we got started today, a lot of jobs. Are gone and they're not coming back, and that's where the self-esteem that's where the self-esteem and identity come in people, it's not only that you don't have anything to eat, you don't even have a self anymore to speak of because we typically define ourselves. You know, as Marx put it, you are what you do. And now who are you when your way of life as well as your way of earning a living is no longer available. And it feels like that yearning for self-esteem that we can talk a little bit more because you're you about defining self-esteem is quite interesting when the more aggressive form of the core and just in general your thinking, it made me realize I haven't thought enough about the idea of self-esteem. But the thing I want to say is it feels like when you lose your job. Then it's easy to find it's it's tempting to find that self-esteem in a tribe. That's not somehow often positive. That's exactly it's like a tribe that defines itself on the hatred of somebody else. So that's brilliant. And this is what John Gray, the philosopher in the 1990s, he predicted what's happening today. He wrote a book about globalism. And actually Hannah Arendt in the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianism when she said that, you know, that economics has reached the point where most money is made not by actually making stuff. You know, you use money to make money. And therefore, what happens is money chases money across national boundaries. Ultimately, governments become subordinate to the corporate entities whose sole function is to generate money. And what John Gray said is that that will inevitably produce economic upheaval in local areas, which will not be attributed to the economic order. It will be misattributed to her, whoever the scapegoat de jure is, and the anger and the distress associated with that uncertainty will be picked up on by ideological demagogues who will transform that into rage. So both Hannah Arendt as well as John Gray, they they just said, watch out. We're going to have right wing populist movements where demagogues who are the alchemists of hate, what makes them brilliant is they don't they don't. The hate is already there, but they take the fears and they expertly redirect them to who it is that I need to hate and kill in order to feel good about myself. So back to your point, Wex. That's right. So the self-regard that used to come from having a job and doing it well and as a result of that, having adequate resources to provide a decent life for your family, well, those opportunities are gone and yeah, what's left. So Max Weber's German sociologist at the beginning of the 20th century, he said in times of historical upheaval, we are apt to embrace. He was the one who coined the term charismatic leader, seemingly larger than life individuals who often believe or their followers believe are divinely ordained to rid the world of evil. Yeah. All right. Now, Ernest Becker, he used Weber's ideas in order to account for the rise of Hitler. Hitler was elected and he was elected when Germans were in an extraordinary state of existential distress. And he said, I'm going to make Germany great again right now. What Becker adds to the equation is his claim that what underlies our affection for charismatic populist leaders, good and bad, is death anxiety. All right. Now here's where we come in, where egghead experimental researchers, you know, Becker wrote this book, The Denial of Death, and he couldn't get a job. People just dismiss these ideas as fanciful speculation for which there's no evidence. And and you've done some good experiments. Yeah. And here's where here's where I can be more cavalier and where what I would urge people like what you said, Lex, is ignore my histrionic polemic language, if possible, and step back, if you can, myself included. And let's just consider the the research findings, because in September 11th, 2001, people that are old enough to remember that horrible day, two days before George W. Bush had the lowest approval rating in the history of presidential polling. All right. Three weeks later, after he said we will rid the world of the evildoers and then a week or two after that, he said in a cover story on Time magazine that he believed that God had chosen him to lead the world during this. The lead the country. There, during this perilous time, he had the highest approval rating, and so we're like, what happened? You know, what happened to Americans that their approval of President Bush got so high, so fast? Well, our view following backor is that 2001 was like a giant death reminder. Yeah, the people dying, plus the symbols of American greatness, World Trade Center and and the Pentagon. So we did a bunch of experiments and most of our experiments are disarmingly simple. We have one group of people and we just remind them that they're going to die. We say, hey, writes your thoughts and feelings about dying, or in other cases we stop them outside, either in front of a funeral home or a hundred meters to either side. Our thought being that if we stop you in front of a funeral home, then death is on your mind even if you don't know it. And then there's other studies there, even more subtle, where we bring people into the lab and they read stuff on a computer. And while they're doing that, we flash the word death for twenty eight milliseconds. It's so fast you don't see anything. And then we just measure people's reactions or behavior thereafter. So what we found in 2003 leading up to the election of 2004 was that Americans did not care for President Bush or his policies in Iraq in control conditions. But if we reminded them of their mortality first, they like Bush a lot more. So in every study that we did, Americans like John Kerry, who was running against Bush, they like Kerry more than Bush policy wise in the control in a control condition. Yeah. And but if if they were reminded of death first, then they like Bush a lot more. So, by the way, just a small pause. He said disarmingly simple experiments. I think that's and people should read worm at the core for some other description. You have a lot of different experience of this nature. I think it's a brilliant experiment connected to the Stoics, perhaps, of how your world view on anything and how delicious that water tastes. Yes. After you're reminded of your own mortality, it's such a fascinating experiment that you could probably keep doing like millions of them to draw insight about the way we see the world. No, that's right, Lex. And I appreciate the compliment, not because we did anything, but because what these studies, many of which are now done by other people around the world in labs that we're not connected with what I'm most proud about our work. I am proud of the experiments that we've done. But it's not science until somebody else can replicate your findings and independent researchers are interested in pursuing them. It's such a fascinating idea. I don't have to think about a lot about the experiments you've done. And they you've inspired about the fact that death changes the way you see a bunch of different things. I think the Stoics talked about the I mean, in general, just Memento Mori like just thinking about death and meditating on death is a really positive, not a positive. It's an enlightening way to live life. So what do you think about that at the individual level? What is the role about being bringing that terror of death, fear of death to the surface and being cognizant of it? For us? That's the that's the ballgame. So what we write in our book and here we're just paying homage to the philosophers and theologians that come before us is to point out the literately since antiquity there has been a consensus that. To lead a full life requires Albert Camus and come to terms with death thereafter. Anything is possible. And so you've got the Stoics and you got the Epicureans, and then you got the Tibetan Book of the Dead. And then you got like the medieval monks that, you know, worked with like a skull on their desk. And the whole idea, I should back up a bit because and just remind folks that our studies, you know, when we remind people that they're going to die and we find that, yeah, they drink more water, if a famous person is is, you know, advertising it, they eat more cookies, they want more fancy clothes. They sit closer to people that look like them. It changes who they vote for. But all of those things, those are very subtle death reminders. You don't even know that death is on your mind. And so our point is, is that and this is kind of counterintuitive and that is that the most problematic and unsavory human reactions to death anxiety are malignant manifestations of repressed death anxiety. You know, we try and bury it under the psychological bushes and then it comes back to bear bitter fruit. But what the theologians and the philosophers of the world are saying is it behooves each of us to spend considerable time. You don't have to be gothe death rocker, you know, wallowing in death imagery to spend enough time. Entertaining the reality of the human condition, which is that you, too, will pass. To get to the point where there is a to lapse into a cliche, the capacity for personal transformation and growth, let's go personal for a second. Are you yourself afraid of death? Yeah. I mean, how much do you meditate on that thought? Like maybe your own study of it is a kind of escape from your own mortality? Absolutely. So you've got it. And like, if you figure out death, somehow, you won't die. So. No, no. So my my colleagues and good friends, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Leonski, you know, we met in graduate school in the 1970s. We've been doing this work for 40 years. And we cheerfully admit, even though it doesn't reflect well on us as humans, that I should just speak for myself. But I I feel like there's a real sense in which doing these studies and writing books and lecturing has been my way of avoiding directly confronting my anxieties by turning it into an intellectual exercise. And and every once in a while there, for one, I think that I'm making some progress as a human. I have to remind myself that that is probably not the case and that I have at times, like all humans, been more preoccupied with the implications of these ideas for my self-esteem. I was like, oh, we're going to write a book and maybe we'll get to go on TV or something. Well, no, that's not the same as to actually think about it in a way that you feel it rather than just think it. Yeah. Did day when you were eight. I said, that's exactly right. So when I first read The Denial of Death, I was so literally flabbergasted by it that I took a leave of absence for a year. And just like. Did what would be considered menial jobs. I did construction work, I worked in a restaurant and I was just like, wait a minute, if if I if I understand what this guy is saying, then I'm just a culturally constructed meat puppet doing things for reasons that I know, not in order to assuage death anxiety. And I say that that that's not acceptable. Maybe another interesting person to talk about is Ernest Becker himself. Sure. So how did he faces death? Is there something interesting personal? I think it's so interesting to me. Is Becker, also from a Jewish family, claimed to be atheistic, did not identify. Ultimately, as Jewish, I believe he converted to Christianity, but was himself a religious person, and he said he became religious when his first child was born, not religious. What does that mean? What does he have a faith in? Well, let's talk. More importantly is the afterlife. He was his view on the afterlife. He was agnostic on that, but he did. Now, the denial of death is there's a chapter devoted to Kierkegaard and he talks about. For Kierkegaard, if you want to become a mature individual, you know, if you want to learn something, you go to the university. If you want to become a more mature individual, according to Kierkegaard, you got to go to the you've got to go to the school of anxiety. And what Kierkegaard said is that we have to let this vague dis ease put a hyphen between dis and ease about death. Kierkegaard point is, you have to really. Think about that, you have to think about it and feel it, you've got to let it sink in or seep into your mind, at which point, according to Kierkegaard, basically you realize that your present identity is fundamentally a cultural construction. You didn't choose the time and place of your birth. You didn't choose your name. You know, you didn't choose necessarily even the social role that you occupy. You might have chosen from what's available in your culture, but not from the full palette of human opportunities. And so what Kierkegaard said is that we need to realize that we've been living a lie of sorts. Becker calls it a necessary lie. And and we have to momentarily dispose of that. And so now Kierkegaard says, well, here I am. I have shrugged off all of the cultural accoutrements that I have used to define myself. And now what am I or who am I? This is like the ancient Greek tragedy where the worst thing was to be No. One or no thing. All right. At this point, Kierkegaard said you're really dangling on the precipice of oblivion and some people tumble into that abyss and never come out. On the other hand, Kierkegaard said that what you can now do, metaphorically and literally, is to rebuild yourself from the ground up. And there's a in the New Testament, there's something you have to die in order to be reborn. And Kierkegaard view, though, is that there's only one way to do that. This is his proverbial leap into faith. And in Kierkegaard case, it was faith and Christianity that you can't have unbridled faith and cultural constructions. The only thing that you can have unequivocal faith in is some kind of transcendent power. All right. But of course, this raises the question of, well, is that just another death denying belief system? Right. And at the end of the denial of death, Bakker admits that there's no way to tell while still advocating for what is ultimately a religious stance. Now, one of the things that I don't understand and Becker has been the most singularly potent influence in my academic and personal life. But a year or two ago, I started reading Martin Heidegger. I'm reading Being in Time. And what I now wonder is why? Why Becker, who refers to Heidegger from time to time in his work, why he didn't take Heidegger more seriously? Because Heidegger has this is like a secular Kierkegaard. He's he has the same thing, which is death anxiety on. I should have pointed out that what Kierkegaard says is that death anxiety. Most people don't go to the school of anxiety. They flee from death anxiety by embracing their cultural beliefs. Kierkegaard says they then tranquilise themselves with the trivial and I love that phrase, beautiful. It's a beautiful phrase because at the end of the denial of death, Bakker's like, look, the average American is either drinking or shopping or watching television and they're all the same thing. All right. Heidegger says the same thing. He says, look, and he acknowledges Kierkegaard. He says, what makes us feel unsettled? Evidently, that's an English translation of angst that in that it's we don't feel at home in the world. Heidegger says that's death anxiety. And One Direction is the Kierkegaard one. He Heidegger calls it a flight from death. You just unself reflexively clinging to your cultural constructions. And Heidegger borrows the term tranquillised. But he points out that he doesn't care for that term because tranquillised sounds like you're subdued when in fact what most culturally constructed meat puppets do is to be frenetically engaged with their surroundings to ensure that they never sit still long enough to actually think about anything consequential. Heidegger says. There's another way, though. He's like, Yo, what you can do is to come to terms with that anxiety in the following way thing. No one is to realize that not only are you going to die, but your death can happen. At any given moment, so for Heidegger, if you say, I know I'm going to die and some vaguely unspecified future moment, that's still death denial because you're saying, yeah, not me, not now. Yeah. Heidegger's point is you need to get to the point where you need to realize that, you know, I need to realize that I can walk outside and get smoked by a comet or I can stop for gas on the way home and catch the virus and be dead in two days or any number of potentially unanticipated and uncontrollable fatal outcomes. But annealing, by the way, it's a way to bring into the now. Yeah, it is brilliant. I agree. Waxen. And that's why I'm wondering why didn't backor notice this? Because that's the being and time thing is it's got to be now and then he says so OK, so now I've dealt somewhat with the the death part and now he says now you've got to deal with what he calls existential guilt. And he says, well alright, what you have to you have to realize the like good or not, you have to make choices. You know, this is Jean-Paul Sartre. We are condemned by virtue of consciousness to choosing. But Heidegger is a little bit more precise. He's like, look, as I was saying earlier, you're. In reality, you're an insignificant speck of respiring, carbon based dust born into a time and place not of your choosing when you're here for a microscopic amount of time after which you are not, and for Heidegger. You have to realize that, like I said, I didn't choose to be born a male or Jewish or in America, the offspring of working class people and Heidegger, what he says is, yeah, but you still have to make choices and accept responsibility for those choices, even though you didn't choose any of the parameters that ultimately limit what's available to you. And moreover, you're going to not always make good choices. So now you're you're guilty for your choices. And then he uses the poet Rilke. He has a phrase, Becker uses it in the denial of death, the guilt of unlived life. I just love that you have to accept that you have already diminished and in many ways amputated your own possibilities by virtue of choices that you've made or just as often have declined to make. Because you are reluctant to accept responsibility for for the opportunities that you are now able to create by virtue of seeing the possibilities that lay before you. So anyway, Heidegger then says, look, OK, so, you know, I'm a professor and I live in America in the 21st century. Well, if I was in the third century, living in a year in Mongolia, I'm not going to have an opportunity to be a professor. But what he submits is that there is some aspects of whatever I am that are independent of my cultural and historical circumstances. In other words, there is a me of sorts. Heidegger would take vigorous issue. So what Heidegger scholars, because I'm not claiming to understand him. This is my classic comic book rendering. But Heidegger's point is that you get to the point where you're able to say, OK. I am a contingent, historical and cultural artifact. But so what you know, if I was, you know, not if I was transported a thousand years in the past in Asia, I'd be in the same situation. I would still be conditioned by time and place. I would still have choices that I could make within the confines of what opportunities are afforded to me. And then Heidegger says, if I can get that far in this is his language, he says that there is a transformation and he literally he calls it a turning. You're turning away from a flight from death and you are allowed you therefore you see a horizon as his word of opportunity that makes you. In a state of anticipatory resoluteness with solicitous regard for others. That makes your life seem like an adventure, perfused with unshakable joy. All right, let me unpack. It is beautiful. It is. I love that you're resonating to the time thing. So he's like, OK, we already talked about now anticipatory is is already hopeful because it's looking forward to be resolute. It means to be steadfast and and to just have confidence in what you're doing moving forward. All right. Solicitous. I had to look up all these words, by the way, is it just means that you are concerned about your fellow human beings. And but I love the idea. Even if it seems allegorical, I don't mind. Not at all. This idea you said love earlier. And I think that when Heidegger is talking about being solicitous, that's as close as he can get. There's an Italian. Yes. Sight in trouble. So what was that line again with the solicitous of the whole thing of turning away from death? And then, yeah, he made all the words you said. It's just beautiful. I love those words. Yeah. Anticipatory resoluteness that is accompanied with solicitous regard to our fellow humans, which makes life appear to us to be an ongoing adventure that is permeated by unshakable joy. Now, again, Heidegger's not Mary Poppins. This guy's got a tattoo. No, I'm not great. I just love that exact quote. No, I'm piecing together these are his exact words that I spent the last two years reading, almost everything that I can find because I want to I'm sick to death. You said it. So I want to second what you say, Lex. So it's not about death. It's the Sherwood Anderson guy. He's a novelist that I like about. He wrote a book called Winesburg, Ohio. And now I'm going to forget what he said on his tombstone. But, you know, it was something to the effect. Oh, he said life, not death, is the great adventure. The point being is that, you know, that to consider that we must die. And the existential implications of that, really the goal, the way I see it, is getting from hate to to love. Yeah. And I feel like Heidegger has. A way of thinking about things that moves us more in that direction and so that's kind of my current preoccupation is to take what I just said to you and to talk about it with my colleagues and other academic psychologists, because the way we started with Ernest Becker, remember I said earlier I wasn't trained in any of these things. I'm an egghead researcher that was doing experiments about biofeedback. And, you know, then we read these backor books. And I thought they were so interesting that for the first few years we didn't have any studies. I just would travel around and I'd be like, here's what this Becker guy says. I think this is cool. Yeah, well, my my present view is I'm like, here's what this Heidegger guy says, I think. These ideas are consistent with what Becker is saying, because they are anchored in death anxiety. But I like that direction as an alternative to the Kierkegaard insistence that the only psychologically tenable way to extricate ourselves from maladaptive reactions to death anxiety is through faith in the traditional sense. Yeah, I always kind of saw Kierkegaard unfairly, like you said, in a comic book sense of the word faith in a non-traditional sense. I kind of like the idea of leap of faith. Oh, I love that idea. And so what I've been babbling about with, you know, Kierkegaard or Heidegger, I'm like, yeah, Kierkegaard is a leap of faith in God. Heidegger's a leap of faith in life. And I just yeah, I like it. I found the leap of faith really interesting in so in the technological space. So I've I've talked to on this thing with Elon Musk, but I think he's also just in general for our culture, a really important figure. Oh, absolutely. That takes I mean, sometimes a little bit insane on on social media and just in life when I met him was kind of interesting. That, of course, there's. I mean, he's a legit engineer, so he's fun to talk to about the technical things. Yeah, but he also just just the way the humor and the way he sees life, it just like refuses to be conventional. Yeah. So it's a constant leap into the unknown. And one of the things that he does and this isn't even this isn't even like fake. A lot of people say because he's a CEO, that's a business owner. So he's trying to make money. No, I think as I looked him in his eyes, I mean, this is real is a lot of the things he believes that are going to be accomplished, that a lot of others are saying are impossible, like autonomous vehicles. He truly believes that to me, that is the leap of faith of I'm was going like we're like the entirety of our experience is shrouded in mystery. Yeah. We don't know what the hell's going to happen. What you don't know what we're actually capable of as human beings. And he just takes the leap. He fully believes that we can you know, we can go to what we can colonize Mars. Yeah. I mean, how how crazy is it to just believe and dream and actually be taking steps towards it? Yeah. To colonizing Mars when most people are like, that's the stupidest idea ever. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm in agreement with you on, you know, two things. You know, one is it reminds me of Ben Franklin, who in his autobiography, you know, has a similarly childish in the best sense of the word unbridled imagination for what might become, you know, Ben Franklin. So I guess I got electricity. That's cool. But we'll be levitating soon, and I can't even begin to imagine what we are capable of. And of course, people are like, dude, that's crazy. And there's a guy with it's FCF Schiller, some humanistic guy at the beginning of the 20th century. He's like, you know, lots of things that people think about may appear to be absurd to the point of obscene, but the reality is historically. Every fantastic innovation has generally been initiated by someone who was condemned for being a lunatic. And it's not that anything is possible, but surely things that we don't try will never manifest as possibilities. Yeah, and that's that's that there's something beautiful to that that's there embracing the abyss. And again, it's like the it's the embracing, the fear of death, the reality of death and then turning into look at all the opportunities, I guess. That's right. Let me ask you, whenever I bring up Ernest Barker's work, which I do and yours quite a bit, I find it surprising. How that it's not a lot more popular in the sense that, no, I don't mean just your book. Know that's what written people should read it, you buy it, whatever I think has the same kind of qualities that are useful to think about as like Jordan Peterson's work and stuff like that. But I just mean, like, why people are not don't think of that as a compelling description of the core of the human condition. Like, I think what you mentioned about Heidegger was quite conclusively, quite well. So I ask on this podcast, I often ask people if they're afraid of death. That's like almost every single almost always get criticized for asking world class people, a scientist and technologist, and about fear of death and the meaning of life. And on the fear of death, they often. Like, don't say anything interesting, what I mean by that is they haven't thought deeply about it, like you kind of brought this up a few times of really letting it sink in. They kind of say this thing about what exactly you said, which is like it's something that happens not today. Like I'm aware that it's something that happened. And I'm not the thing that usually says I'm not afraid of death. I just want to live a good life kind of thing. And what I'm trying to express is like when I look in their eyes and the kind of the the core of the conversation, it looks like they haven't really become like they haven't really meditated on death. I guess the question is, what do I say to people that there's something to really think about here? Like. There's some demons, some realities that need to be faced by more people. Well, that's a tough one. You know, I could tell you what not to do, you know, so when we are young and annoying. Yeah, a lot of famous people, mostly psychologists, because that's who we intersected with, that, you know, we would lay out these ideas and they would be well, I don't think about death like that. So these ideas must be wrong and we would say, well, you don't think about death because you're lucky enough to be comfortably ensconced in a cultural world view from which you derive self-esteem, and that has spared you the existential, excruciating science that would otherwise arise. But that's like Freud, you know, you're repressing. Say you're either agree with me, in which case I'm right. Or you disagree with me, in which case you're repressing and I'm right. Well, so that's the the nuclear thing. What I felt when I've been moment in my life, moments in my life when I really thought about death, I mean, there's not too many, like, really, really thought about it and feel a thing when you felt that eight maybe traumatizing or romanticizing it. But I feel like it's the conservatives call it popularly like the movie Matrix. Call it the red pill moment. I feel like it's a dangerous thought. Because I feel like I'm taking a step out of a society like there's a nice narrative that we've all constructed, you are. And I'm taking a step out and. It feels this feeling like you're basically drowning. I mean, it's not a good feeling, it is not. But this gets back to the Heidegger Kierkegaard School of Anxiety. You are stepping out. Yeah. And you are momentarily shrugging off the, again, the culturally constructed psychological accoutrements that allow you to stand up in the morning. And so, I mean that in that sense, it feels like. I mean. What do you how do you have that conversation, because I guess I'm dancing around a set of questions, which is like I guess I'm disappointed that people don't are not as willing to step outside, like even just even any kind of thought experiment. Forget Donald like. Others, there's now a community of people let's to take an easy one that I think is scientifically ridiculous, which is a community of people that believe that the earth is flat. Yeah, or actually even better because the space is fake. Yeah. Like, what I find surprising is that a lot of people I talked to are not willing. To be like, imagine if it is like, imagine the earth is flat, like think about it. A lot of people just like know the earth is round. They're like like scientists, too. They're like, yes, well actually we have you actually like thought about it like imagine like it's a thought experiment that like basically step outside a little narrative that we are comfortable with. Now that one in particular is has really strong evidence and scientific validation. So it's a pretty simple thing to show that at least is not flat, but just the willingness to take a step outside of the stories that bring us comfort. It's been disappointing that people are not willing to do that. And I think the philosophy that you've constructed and that respect is constructing, you've tested, I think is really compelling in the fact that people are often willing to take that step. Yeah, that's the point. Well, yes, but perhaps understandable. I mean, this is an anecdote, of course. But when we were trying to get a publisher for our book, I had we had a meeting with the. A publisher who. Published some Malcolm Gladwell books. Yeah, and she said, I'm very interested in your book, but can you write it without mentioning death? Because people don't like death and we're like now it's really kind of central. And I think that's part of it. I think, again, if these ideas have merit. And I actually like the way that you put it works, it's that to step away is to momentarily expose yourself to all of. The anxiety. Yeah, but our identity and our beliefs typically enable us to manage, I think it's as simple as that. Yeah, I had this experience. In college with my best friend, who got really high and he forgot it was in the winter, it was really freezing, as memorable to me, I think it's an analogy is very useful. So he went to get some pizza and of course and he so I and he left me outside and said, I'll be back in five minutes. And he forgot that he left me outside. And I remember it was I was in like shorts. Yeah. It was freezing winter. Wow. And I remember standing outside the dorm and I'm looking from the outside in. It's a light is warm and I'm just standing there frozen and think for an hour or more. And that's how I think about it. Like, I just I don't give a damn about the stupid winter. I just want to I like it's like I'm drawn to be back to the warm. Yes. And that's how I feel about thinking about like death is like, yeah. At a certain point it's like it's too much. It's like that cold. Like I want to be back in one of the warm then getting back to hydrograph for a moment, I like the yeah. He uses a lot the idea of feeling at home, not as like in your house but just feeling like you're comfortably situated. Maybe you can talk about like I had a conversation about this with my dad a little bit. How does religion relate to this? I see it as the the disease and the cure in in a sense. A few things. One is that. I think a case could be made that humans are innately religious, so now we're going to get into territory where there's going to be a lot of disputes. And what do you mean by religious? Religion is an evolutionary adaptation and religion is like a belief in something outside of yourself kind of thing. Not necessarily. So here we got to be a little bit more careful. And again, I'm not a scholar. How about I'm a well-intentioned dilatant in in this regard? Because what what I have read is that religion evolved. Very early on, long before our ancestors were conscious and the issue of death arose and the word religion evidently is from a Latin word rogatory, we can look it up, but and it means to bind. And Emile Durkheim, the dead French sociologist, he said, you know, originally religion is a Darcel passing who's a dead novelist. She calls it the substance of we feeling that it's literally that it erodes because we're uber social creatures who from time to time took comfort in just being in physical proximity with our fellow humans, and that there is this kind of sense of transcendent exuberance just back to the unshakable joy that Heidegger alludes to and that the original function of religion was to foster social cohesion and coordination and that it was only subsequently some claim that a burgeoning level of consciousness made it such that religious belief systems that included the hope of some kind of immortality were just naturally selected thereafter. So there are some people. So it's David Sloan. Wilson wrote a book called Darwin's Cathedral, and he said religion has nothing to do with death. It's evolved to make groups viable. He's actually a group selection guy with group selection, the idea that it's the group that is selected for rather than the individual. So people have vigorous disagreements about that. But I guess our point would be we see religion as being inextricably, inextricably connected ultimately to assuaging concerns about death. I guess another question to ask around this, like, what is the world look like without religion? Will we if it's an extra bleak, inextricably connected to our fears of death, do you think it always returns to some kind of shape? Maybe it's not called religion, but whatever it is just keeps returning. Yeah. You know, so that's that's a great question. So there's a woman named Karen Armstrong. She was a nun turned historian. And she's I can't remember the name of the book, but no matter, she we could look that up, but I can look it up and I can also get added. OK. Yeah, her point has gotten the title, of course. But, you know, she's like, look, all religions. Are generally fairly right-minded in that they advocate the golden rule. And all religions at their best do seem to foster prosocial behavior towards the ingroup, and that confers both psychological as well as physical benefits. That's the good news, and the bad news is historically, all religions are. Subject to being hijacked by a lunatic fringe. Who declares that, you know, they're the ones in sole possession of the liturgical practices or whatever they call them, and they're the ones that turn, you know, religion at its best in the year crusades and Holocaust's? My view, not that it should matter for much, but I I'm. I grew up just skeptical of religion because I'm like as a kid, I'm like, well, if we didn't have these beliefs, we wouldn't be killing each other because of them. And I'd be like to my parents. Well, you're telling me that all people should be judged on the merits of their character, but don't come home if you don't marry a Jewish woman. Right. Which is implying that if you're not Jewish, you're an inferior form of life. Yeah, that's what tribes always do. And there's the tribal thing. And so there's a guy name Amin Maluf, a Lebanese guy who writes in French in the 1990s, I think. Wrote a book called In the Name of Identity, Violence and the Need to Belong, and that was his point, is that unless we can overcome this tribal mentality, this will not end well. But but you said earlier, something like that I think is profound and profoundly important. And that is you did not recoil in horror when I mentioned Kierkegaard use of the term faith. And so I'm a big fan of faith. And I'm not sure what that implies, I have and by the way, this is just the peripheral comment, but I find less resistance to Beckers ideas in our work when I'm in like Jesuit schools, you know, it's the Americans that, you know, the secular humanists who are most disinclined to accept these ideas. It's an important side comment because I think it's mostly because they don't think philosophically that's I mean, I speak with a lot of scientists and I think that's my main criticism is you don't I mean, that's the problem with science. Exactly. Is it's so comforting to focus in on the details that you can escape. Thinking about the mystery of it all, the big picture things, the philosophical like the fact that you don't actually know shit at all like that, that that that they are so that in terms of jazzer, like, that's that's the beauty of the experience of faith and so on is like, well, how wherever that journey takes you is you actually explore the biggest questions of our world. Yeah. Yeah. So I don't see religion going away because I don't see humans. As capable of surviving without faith and hope and. Everyone from the pope to Elon Musk will acknowledge that it is a world that is unfathomably mysterious and like it or not, in the absence of belief serum, Charles Persse, the pragmatic philosopher, he just said beliefs are the basis of action. If you don't have any beliefs, you're paralyzed within decision, whether we're aware of it or not, whether we like it or not, in order to stand up in the morning, you have to subscribe to beliefs that can never be unequivocally proven right or wrong. Well, then why do you maintain them? Well, ultimately, it's because of some form of faith. But also also faith shouldn't be a dogmatic thing that you should always be leaping. Yeah, I guess the problem with science or with religion is you could sort of know all of a sudden take a step into a place where you're super confident that you know the absolute truth of things. There you go again. Back to Socrates, Plato, back in the cave, you know, at Skidmore, where I work, that's what I have the students read in their first week, you know, in Plato's, like, look at all those poor bastards. You know, they're in the cave, but they don't know it, you know, and then they are freed from their chains. And I have to be dragged out of the cave, by the way, which is another interesting point. They don't run out, but that gets back to why people don't like to be divested of their comfortable illusions. But anyway, they get dragged out of the cave into the sunlight, which she claims is a representation of truth and beauty. And I say to the students, well, what's wrong with that? And they're like, nothing. That's like, awesome. And then I'm like, Yo, dudes. You out of the cave, but how do you know that you're not in another cave? The illumination may be better, but the minute you think. You're at the end of the proverbial. Intellectual slash epistemological trail. Then you have already succumbed to either laziness or dogmatism or both, that's really well put, that's both terrifying and exciting that we're always it's there's always a bigger cave, a little bit of an outer question. But I think some of the interesting qualities of the human mind is the ideas of intelligence and consciousness. So what do you make of consciousness? Do you think death creates consciousness like the fear of death? The terror of death creates consciousness and. Consciousness, in turn, magnifies the terror of death, I do, I think what is consciousness, you don't ask me that. So now that if I could answer that, you know, I'd be chugging rum out of a coconut with my Nobel Prize that, you know, it's literally, you know, Steven Pinker, I do agree with his claim. And I think how the mind works that it is the key question for. The psychological science is broadly defined in the 21st century, what is conscious, yeah, what is consciousness? And I don't think it's an AP phenomenological afterthought. So a lot of people I think Dan Wegner at Harvard, a lot of folks consider it just the ass and of a process that by the time we are aware of what it is, it's just basically an integrated rendering of something that's already happened. You know, evidently the there's a half second delay between when something happens, you know, those studies and our awareness of it. Um, that and then that's where, like ideas of free will will step. And you can explain away a lot of stuff. And I think those are all important and interesting questions am of the persuasion. I mean, even not even but Dawkins in The Selfish Gene. It is very thoughtful, actually, in a lot of it's actually more in notes than in the text of the book, but he's just like, it's hard for me to imagine that consciousness doesn't have some sort of important and highly adaptive function. And what Dawkins says is he thought about it in terms of just the way that we could do mental simulations, that one possibly extraordinary product of consciousness is to rather than find out. Often by adverse consequences through trying something would be to run mental simulations. And so one possibility is that consciousness is highly adaptive. Another possibility is Nicholas Humphrey, a British dude who wrote a book about I think it's called Regaining Consciousness. And he hypothesized, I think this 1980s, maybe even earlier, that consciousness arose as a way to better predict the behavior of others in social settings, that by knowing how I feel, makes me better able to know how you may be feeling this like the rudiments of a theory of mind. And it really may not have had anything to do with intelligence so much as social intelligence. So so in that sense, consciousness is a social construct. I guess it's just just a useful thing for interacting with the. Yeah. I don't know. But there seems to be something about realizing your own mortality that somehow intricately connected to the idea of consciousness. Well, I think so also. So this is where and nature he said a solitary creature would not need consciousness or what do you think? Well, I don't know what I think about that, but what I do then then he goes on to say that consciousness is the most calamitous stupidity by which we shall someday perish. And wow, I was like, dude, relax. Yeah, but so what if you say you are on an island alone and you saw a reflection of yourself in the water, like if you are alone your whole life. Yeah, great question. His view Nietzsche's view would be that your thoughts of yourself would never come to mind. I don't know how I feel about that. In a sense, this sounds weird, but in a sense I feel like my mental conversations has always been with death. It's almost like another, you know, another notion like, uh, you know, these visualizations of of a death in the clock, like I always felt like I am a living thing. And then there's one other thing that is the end of me. And I'm having a conversation with that in the sense that that's the way I construct my the fact that I am a thing is because there's somebody else that tells me, well, you won't be a thing eventually. Wow. This feels like a conversation, perhaps. But that's that might be kind of this mental stimulation kind of idea that you're you're kind of it's not really it's a conversation with yourself, essentially. Sure. Yeah. But yeah, I don't know how I feel about that, but I tend to be in agreement with you when we're talking about economics. More so. That that we're deeply social beings like everything, the way it just feels like we're humans, I'm with Harari, with Slepian's, that we're kind of we seem to construct ideas on top of each other. And that's a fundamentally a social. Absolutely. I think that's a fine book. It overlaps considerably with our take on these matters. And the fact that we get to these points drawing on different sources, I think makes me more confident that it's so fascinating, just like reading your book and so on a small tangent. That sapience. Is like one of the most popular books in the world. Like, yeah, and it's reading your book is like all the sounds. Yeah, well, I mean, like, I don't know I don't know what makes a popular book. Yes. Well, if you want me to be petty and stupid, I will tell you that from time to time. We also wonder why our book, you know, like all books, people can take issue with it. But we thought it would be a bigger hit that would be more widely read. And it's funny because I. I have. I don't know if I have good examples, I forgot already, but I'm often saddened by like Franz Kafka. I think he wasn't known in his life. Yeah, but I always wonder, like, these. Great. Yeah. Like, some of the greatest books ever written are completely unknown during the author's lifetime. And it's like, man, for some reason that it's against the identity thing. I think, man, this sucks. Well, I'm comforted by that. So Van Gogh sold one painting in his life and evidently Thoreau sold like 75 copies of Walden Nature's books did not sell well. And how did Ernest Becker so he he is the his books are published by the Free Press and have sold more than any other books that they have published. So so it's I mean, it's a lot I don't know if it's like Jordan Peterson millions, but it's hundreds of thousands you respected. I just don't see him. OK, yeah. I don't see him brought up as like in the top 10 philosophers of. No, not at all. So. How far away is in the top hundred for people? I don't think so. No, he doesn't. He's not brought up that often because, again, like, your work is borne out more often. Yeah, I like terrible. Like, because I think it got you. Yeah. I mean, I think he's one of the great philosophers of the 20th century. So what really works is that our goal certainly when we first started and now just as much actually. But what I say it all my talk is, look, if these ideas have interest you enough to go read Ernest Bakker, then this has been good. I consider him to be one of the most important voices of the 20th century who does not get the attention that he deserves. All right. Similarly. Our work, I believe, to be important because point by point, we provide empirical corroboration for all of the claims. If you know when that so that's literally the students that read the denial of death and then escape from evil. They're like, yeah, wow. Every chapter of the book, you have studies. And I'm like, yeah, because for 40 years for Skidmore, students said, oh, that's got to be bullshit. I'm like, well, let's do a study, let's just study in. My own dreams are in creating. Robots and artificial intelligence systems that a human can love, and I think there's something about mortality and fear of mortality that is essential for implementing in our systems. Yeah, and so maybe can you comment on that? Like. Well. And so this is this is a different perspective, I know for sure. Which is like how do we engineer a human. Yeah. So no, this is awesome. Lack's I'm delighted that you said that first of all, and I may mention this to you and I don't I can't remember because I'm saying now when you first contacted me. Yeah. I had just been told I have to learn more about your work because I'm working with some very talented people in New York, and they're they're writing a screenplay for a movie about an artificial intelligence. It's a female A.I. set in like 30 years in the future. And basically, the little twist, this is how I had to read Heidegger. So these people call me and they're like, we're making a movie. It's based on Bekker and your work and Heidegger and this other philosopher, Levinas, and then another philosopher, Sylvia Danso, who's an Italian philosopher. And the long short story is the movie is about supposedly the most advanced artificial intelligence entity, an embodied one, and who human form, human form, who finds out who is having. Having essentially existential anxieties and the I think the project is called a dinner with her or something, and it doesn't really matter, but the punch line is that she finds out that her creator. Has made her. Mortal and so the question is what happens phenomenologically and behaviourally? To on an artificial intelligence, who now knows that it's mortal and it's actually the same question that you're posing. Yeah, and that is, is that necessary? In order for an AI AI to approximate humanity, yeah, I think yeah, so the intuition, again, it's unknown, but I think it's absolutely I think it's absolutely necessary. A lot of people, the same kind of shallow thinking that people have about our own end of life, our own death is the same way people think. I think about artificial intelligence. It's like, well, OK, so, yeah. So within the system, there's a there's a terminal position where like there's a point at which it ends. The program ends. There's a goal state. There's you reached an end point. But the thing is making that end a thing that's also within the program like like the making the thing like and there's also the mystery of it. The thing is, we don't know what the hell that thing is. And it's not like it's not like we I mean, the program doesn't give us information about the meaning of it all, Zakho. And that's where the terror is. And it feels like I mean, in the language that you would think about, this is the terror of this death or the anticipation of it or thinking about it is the creative force that builds everything. Right. And that feels like, you know, that feels really important to implement. Again, very difficult to know how to do technically currently. But it's important to think about what I find is you like Screenplay's and so on is sci fi. Folks and philosophers are the only ones thinking about it currently. And that's what these folks have convinced me. Yeah, and engineers aren't, which is I get. Yeah, most most most of the things they talk about, I get kind of people roll their eyes from these books that they're like because again, I saw your name and I'm like women. I've just seen that. They're like, here's someone you should check out. Yeah. So this was a delightful confluence. Yeah. There's a huge fan of your work and Ernest Becker, and it's funny that none of people are. I'm talking about it. I don't know what to do with that. I think that there is a possibility to create real deep, meaningful connections between A.I. systems and humans. Absolutely. And I think some of these things of immortality are essential, that are essential for the element of human experience. I don't I don't think it might be essential to create general intelligence like very intelligent machines, but to create a machine that connects to a human in some deep way. What's your view? Not to make me the interviewer, but what's your view about machine ethics? Can you imagine an ethical a I without some semblance of. Yeah, finitude like to say, well, I think ethics, it's a you know, there's a trolley problem that's often used in the work that I've done on my team. Yeah. And with with autonomous vehicles in particular. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That people. I think they offload, they ask, like, how would a machine deal with an ethical situation that they themselves humans don't know how to deal sacrifice. And so. I don't know if a machine is able to do a better job on difficult ethical questions, but I certainly think to behave properly and effectively in this world, it needs to be have a fear of mortality and be able to even dance, because I don't think you can solve ethical problems. But you have to I think ethics is like a dance for you. You have to just you have to dance properly with the rest of the humans that give people the tango. You have to dance in the same kind of way. And for that, you have to have with your own mortality, like I think of more practically speaking, as an autonomous vehicles, like the way you interact with pedestrians. Fundamentally has to have a sense of mortality. So when pedestrians cross the road and now I've watched most certainly one hundred plus hours of pedestrian videos. There's a kind of social contract where you walk in front of a car and you're putting your life in the hands of another. Yes, that's right. And like, death is is is in the car in the game that's being played. Death is right there. It's part of the calculus. It's not. But it's not like a simple calculus, not a simple equation. It's it's an it's a I mean, I don't know what it is, but it's in it's in there. And it has to be part of the optimization problem. Like, it's not as simple as so from the computer vision, from the artificial intelligence perspective, it's detecting. There's a human estimating. Right, estimating the trajectory like treating everything like it's billiard balls, as opposed to like being able to construct an effective model, the world model of what the person is thinking, what they're going to do. What are the different possibilities of how this scene might evolve, I think requires having some sense of. Yeah, fear of fear of mortality, of mortality. I don't see. The thing is, I think it's really important to think about. I could be honest enough to say that it's I haven't been able to figure out how to engineer any of these things. Right. But I do think it's really, really important to have. So I have a bunch of numbers here. Shortly after that. I've Roomba is a robot, that is. Vacuums the floor, and I've had them make different sounds like I had them scream in pain and it. It you O'Meally anthropomorphize, absolutely, and it creates a. I don't know, knowing that they can feel pain, see, I'm speaking like knowing that I immediately imagine that they can feel pain and it immediately draws me closer to them. Yes. The human experience and that there's something in that that should be engineered in our in our systems. It feels like that, I believe person. I don't know what you think, but I believe it's possible for a robot and a human to fall in love, for example, in the in the future. I think it's yeah, it's already there. I know a certain kind of deep connection with technology in a real like you would choose to marry. I mean, again, it sounds I'll find a book title and I'll send it to you. And it's a serious consideration of people who started out with these sex dolls, but it turned into a relationship of enduring significance that the woman who wrote the book is not willing to dismiss as a perversion. Yeah, that's what you know, people kind of joke about sex robots, which is funny. Like, it's a it's a funny I mean, there's a lot of stuff about robots. This is kind of fun to talk about that is that it's not necessarily connected to reality. People joke about sex robots. But if you actually look how sex robots, which are pretty rare these days, are used, they're not used by people who want sex. Precisely. They're actually their companions, their compared. They become companions. Yeah, it's yeah. It's fascinating. They're just we're not even talking about any kind of intelligence. We're talking about just I mean, human beings see companionships. We're deeply lonely. I mean that's the other sense I have that I don't know if I can articulate clearly. You can probably do a better job, but I have a sense that there's a deep loneliness within all of us. Absolutely. In the face of death, it feels like we're all alone. So, you know, the what drew me to the existential take on things, this was the. Who is it, Rollo May and Erwin Yalom, right about existentialism, and they're like, look at what? There's different flavors of existentialism, but they all have in common. What is it for universal concerns? The overriding one is about death, and that next is choice and responsibility. The next one is existential isolation. And they're like, that's one of the. Things about consciousness, that and the last one is meaninglessness, but the existential isolation point. As you know, we. Ah, by virtue of consciousness, able to apprehend the bin last year, a Siamese twin, you are fundamentally alone. And because it is claimed it's Eric from in a book called Escape from Freedom, he's like, look, you you're smart enough to know that the most direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language. But you also know that language is a pale shadow of the totality of our interior. Phenomenological existence, therefore, there's always going to be times in our lives where even under the best of circumstances, you could be trying desperately to convey your thoughts and feelings and somebody listening could be like, yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it. And you're like, you have no fucking idea what I'm talking about. Yeah. So you can be desperately lonely in a house where you live with 10 people in the middle of Tokyo where there's millions. How is The Great Gatsby to be along party exactly? Maybe this is a small tangibility. Let me ask you on the topic of academia. You're kind of and we talked about Jordan Peterson. There's a lot of sort of renegade type of thinkers, certainly in psychology, but it applies in all disciplines of what are your thoughts about academia being a place to harbor people like yourself, but, you know, people who think deeply about things who are not constrained by sort of the who. I don't think you're quite controversial. No, not really. But you are a person who thinks deeply about things and it feels like academia can sometimes stifle that. I think so. So my concern right now works for young scholars is that. The restrictions and. Expectations are such that it's highly unlikely that anybody will do anything of. Great value or innovation? Except for and this is not a bad thing, but stepwise improvement of existing paradigm, so the you know, it's simple English. You know, I went to Princeton for a job interview 40 years ago and they're like, what are you going to do if we give you a job? And I'm like, I don't know. I want to think about it and read. And and I I saw that that interview was over the window of opportunity shut in my face. And they actually called my mentors. And they're like, what? Are you doing tell this guy to buy some pants? I had hair down to my waist also also this guy looks like Charles Manson. Jesus. But the expectation is that you come to a post, you know, you start publishing so that you can get grants. That's certainly true. But there's also kind of a behavioral thing. You said like long hair. There's there's a certain style of the way you're supposed to behave, for example, like I'm wearing a suit. It sounds it sounds weird, but I feel comfortable in this. You know, I wore it like when I was teaching at MIT. I weren't sure were to meetings and so on, different sometimes the blue and red tie. But like, that was an outsider thing to do at MIT. So there was a strong pressure to not wear a suit. No, that's right. And there's a pressure to behave to have a hair thing. No, that's right. The way you wear your hair, the way you this isn't like a liberal or a loan or anything. It's just in tribes. That's right. And academia to me or a place any place that dreams of having, like, renegade free thinkers, like really deep thinkers should in fact, like, glorify the outsider. Right. You know, should welcome just should welcome, you know, people that don't fit in. Yeah, I know that sounds weird, but I don't I could just imagine an interview with a Princeton. You know, I imagine why aren't people why aren't you at Harvard, for example, at MIT and. Yeah, well, so look, I would love to you know, I haven't lectured at MIT, but I've lectured at Harvard and I've gotten to lecture at almost every place that wouldn't consider me for a job. Yeah. And. I. Well, a few things I'm lucky because I you know, I go to Princeton, I'm like, I don't know what I want to do. And two days later I go to Skidmore and I'm like, I don't know what I want to do. And they offer me a job later that day, which I declined for months because of the extraordinary pressure of my mentors, who right mindedly felt that I wouldn't get much done there. And but what they told me at Skidmore was, take your time, you know, show up for your classes and don't molest barnyard animals and you'll probably get tenure. And I'm like, I'll show up for my classes. We'll talk about it was that was the negotiation I negotiated. I bargain. But but honestly, that's how I feel. I'm very committed to Skidmore because I was given tenure when our first term management paper wasn't published. It took eight years to publish. It was rejected at every journal. And I submitted it as like a purple ditto sheet thing. I'm like, here's what I've been doing. Here's the reviews. Here's why I think this is still a pretty good idea. And I don't know that this would happen even at Skidmore anymore, but I was very lucky to be given the latitude and to be encouraged. I took classes at Skidmore. That's how I learned all this stuff. I graduate. I got a Ph.D. unscathed by knowledge. We were great statisticians and methodologies, but we didn't have any. Substance, you know, and I don't mean this cynically, but we were trained and a method in search of a question. So I appreciate having five years at Skidmore basically to read books. And I also appreciate that I look like this 40 years ago and. My view is. That this is how I comported myself, other people, the guy I learned the most from at Skidmore is not dead, a history professor, Ted Karradah. He wore a bow tie. And there's another guy, Darnell Rocker, who taught me about philosophy. And he was very proper. And he had like his jacket with, like the leather patches. But these guys weren't pompous at all. They were. This is the way I am. And I always felt that that's important, that. Somebody who looks at you and says, oh, what a stiff, he's probably an MBA. Yeah, well, they're wrong. Yeah. And someone who looks at me when I first got to Skidmore, other professors, what I ask when I come into their office to empty the garbage, they just assumed, you know, I was in my 20s, they assumed I was housekeeping. I always thought that was important, that the students learn not to judge an idea by the appearance of the person who pervades it. And, yeah, I mean, that's I guess this is such a high concern now because I personally still have faith that academia is where the great geniuses will come from. I do. To good ideas. I love hearing you say that. I still and it's one of the reasons why I'm really apprehensive about the future of education right now in the context of the pandemic. Oh, yeah. Is that a lot of folks and a lot of these are Google type people who I don't you know, they're geniuses also. But I don't like this idea that all learning can be virtual and that much could happen. I'm big on embodied environments with actual humans interacting. I mean, there's there's so much to the university education. But I think the key part that I this is the the mentorship that occurs somehow and at the human level, like I've gotten a lot of flack like this conversation where in personnel and. I've even with Edward Snowden, who done all interviews remote, I'm a stickler to in person, it has to be in person like and then a lot of people just don't get it. They're like, well, why can't this is so much easier. Like, why go through the pain? Like, I've traveled I'm traveling in the next month to Paris for a single, stupid conversation nobody cares about just to be in person. Well, it's important to me. I honestly, I was like this and thank you for coming down today. It's my pleasure. But again, it's very self-serving. I've enjoyed this. I knew I was going to, but it's not about our enjoyment per say. Again, at the risk of sounding cavalier, there are a host of factors beyond verbal. Yeah. That I don't believe. Can be adequately captured. I don't care how much the acuity is decent on a zoom conversation, I feel again, I felt within five minutes that this was going to be for me. Easy in the sense that I could speak freely, I just don't see that happening so easily from a distance. Yeah, I tend to. Well, I'm hopeful I agree with you on the current technology, but I am hopeful, unlike some others on the technology, eventually being able to create that kind of experience. I think we're quite far away from that. But yeah, might be able. My hope is I'm you know, I'm I'm hopeful. I was at Microsoft in Seattle and I can't remember why. And no, I can't I that's how I'm in my early Mr. Magoo phase and. And somebody there was showing us like a virtual wall where the entire wall. You know, when you're talking to somebody, so it's life size and they were beginning the. Get the appearance of motion and stuff. It look pretty. Yeah, with virtual reality. Chernof you ever been inside a virtual world? Yeah, it's to me it's I can just see the future. It's it's it's quite real. Yeah. In terms of like a terror of death, I'm afraid of heights. Me too. And there's I don't know if you've ever tried to shoot. If you haven't, there's a virtual reality experience. You can walk a plank. Yeah. You can look down, man. I was on the ground like I was like I was afraid. Deeply afraid. I was is it was it was as real as yo as anything else could be. And I mean these are very early days of the technology relatively speaking. So yeah. I mean I don't know what to do with that scene with like crossing the street. We did these experiments. Across the street in front of a car, and, you know, it's being run over by a car. It's terrifying. Yeah, it's just that yeah. So there is a rich experience to be created there. We're not there yet, but. Yeah, and I've seen a lot of people try, like you said, the Google folks, Silicon Valley folks, try to create a virtual online education. I don't know. I think they've raised really important questions like what makes the education experience fulfilling? What makes it effective? Yeah, these are important questions. And I think what they highlight is we have no clue. Like there's. Tommaso wrote a book about a recent book on charter schools. Yeah, I would like to talk to him. Yeah, he's an interesting guy. We disagree about a lot. But respectfully, we are such a powerful mind. Yeah, but he I need to read I've only heard him talk about the book, but he argues quite seemingly effectively that that. That the public education system is broken. That we blame, he basically says that we kind of blame like the conditions or the the environment, but the upbringing of people like parenting, blah, blah, blah, like the the set of opportunities. But OK, putting that aside, it seems like charter schools, no matter who it is that attends them, does much better than in in public schools. And he puts a bunch of data behind it. And in his usual way, as you know, just is very eloquent in arguing his points. Yeah. So that to me just highlights we don't. Education is like one of the most important, the it's probably the most important thing in our civilization. And we're doing a shitty job of it in academia and in university education and, you know, younger education, the whole thing, the whole thing. And yet we value. Just about anyone or anything more than educators, you know, part of it is just the. Relatively low regard. That Americans have for teachers, for teachers, also, similarly, like just people service, I think great teachers are the greatest thing in our society. And I would say now on a controversial note, like Black Lives Matter, you know, great police officers is the greatest thing in our society. Also, like all people that do service, we undervalue cops civil like this whole defund the police is missing the point. And it's a stupid word. I'm with you on that. Blacks are neighbors to one side of our house or three generations of police. Our neighbors across the street are police. They know my. You know, political predilections and we've gotten along fine for 30 years, and I go out and tell them every day, you know, when you go in today, you tell the people on the force. But I appreciate. What they're doing. I think it's really important to not tribal ize those concerns. I mean, we mentioned so many brilliant books and philosophers, but it would be nice, sort of in a focused way to try to see if we can get some recommendations from you. So what three books, technical or fiction or philosophical, had A and B, the worst question? Well, the big impact on your life and you will recommend spent four hours driving here, perseverating about that. I did everything else. You sat me as fine. And I actually I skimmed it and I'm like, I don't want to look at it because I want I want to talk. Yeah. The ones in blue, I'm like, all right. And, you know, I've already said that I've found Bakker's work and I put the denial of death out there is that is best. Sorry, I don't want a small tangent. Is there other books of his. Yes. If I could have this count as one the the birth and death of meaning the denial of death and escape from evil are three books of Ernest Bakker's that I believe to all be profound in a in a little sort of breve dance around topics I've only read now. Death like what? How do those books connect in here. Yeah, nice. Of the the birth and death. The meaning is where Bekker situates his thinking in more of an evolutionary foundation. So I like that for that reason, escape from evil is where he applies the ideas in the denial of death more directly to economic matters and to inequality and also to our inability to peacefully coexist with other folks who don't share our beliefs. So I would put Ernest Becker out there as one of them. I also like novels a lot. And here I was like, God damn it, no matter what I say, I'm going to be like, yes, but. But the existentialist you like all those folks come, oh, you like that literary exercise? I do. But I mean, you know, I've read all those books. I will tell you the last line of the plague. We learn in times of pestilence that there's more to admire in men than to despise. And I love that. Yeah. Plagues such. I don't know. I find the plague is a brilliant Mayta before before the plague has come to us in twenty twenty. It was just so book about love about. But I'll toss a one that may be less known to folks I'm enamored with. A novel by a woman named Carson McCullers written in 1953 called Clock Without Hands. And I find it a brilliant literary depiction of many of the ideas that we have spoken about. Fiction. Fiction. Yeah. What what kind of ideas are we talking about? All of the existential ideas that we have encountered today. But in the context of a story of someone who finds out that he is terminally ill, it's set in the South in the heyday of like segregation. So there's a lot of social issues, a lot of existential issues, but it's basically a fictional account of someone who finds out that they're terminally ill and who reacts originally. As you might expect, anyone becomes more hostile to people who are different, like petty and stupid, denies that anything's happening. But as the book goes on and he comes more to terms with his own mortality, it ends lovingly. And I'm back to your idea of about, you know, love being incredibly potent. That's the nice thing, as you mentioned before, with Heidegger. I really like that idea, and I've seen that in people who are terminally ill is they bring, you know, the idea of death becomes current. Yes, it becomes like a thing. You know, I could die. I really like that idea. I can die not just tomorrow, but like now, now, now. Yeah. That's a really useful I don't even know. I think I've been too afraid to even think about that. Like I have like like sit here and think like in five minutes it's over. Yeah, this is it. This is five minutes. It's over. Yeah. So that would be my most recent addition as I really am struck by Heidegger or would you recommend. Well, OK, well if you have a few you remember I tuned out being in time. I was like I try to read it. Like I said, it's it took me forty years to read Ulysses. I could not get past the first five pages and it took me forty years to read being and time. It's a slog. Yeah. And I took a James Joyce course in college. So have I even I guess read parts of Finnegans Wake. No way. But like there's a difference between reading and like I don't think I understand anything. I like short stories. The dead. The dead. Yeah. Yeah. And I like Faulkner. Absalom Absalom is a is a fine book. But would you is there something Heidegger connected in a book you recommend or. No. No. So maybe I got to abandon him. I mean, I mean being a time is awesome. But here's an interesting thing. And not to get all academic, but, you know, there's two parts to it. And most of the most philosophers are preoccupied with the first part. It's in the second part where he gets into all the flight from death stuff and this idea of, you know, a turning and philosophers don't like that. And I'm like, this is where he's starting really to really shine for me. So, uh, yeah. Well, that's a beautiful set of books. That what? Advice would you give to a young person today about their career, about life? About how to survive in this world for suffering. Yeah, great. Yeah, my advice is to get competent advice and I tell my students that if I don't listen to me, don't listen to me. Well, you know, I think my my big piece of advice these days is, you know, again, it's at the risk of sounding like a simpleton, but it's to emphasize a few things. One is. You know, one of your questions, I think, was, you know, what's the meaning of life? And of course, the existentialists say life has no meaning, but it doesn't follow from that, that it's intrinsic, that it's meaningless. You know what? The existential point is not that life is meaningless so much as it doesn't have one. Inevitable and intrinsic meaning, you know, which then? It opens up, you know, I think it was Kirkegaard who said consciousness gives us the possibility of possibilities and but there's another lunatic, Oswald Spangler, who wrote a book called Decline of the West. And he says that the philosopher, the German philosopher Gerta, he says the purpose of life is to live. And that's so that's one of my pieces of advice. So there's the possibility of possibilities. It's interesting. So what do you do with this kind of sea of possibilities? Well, this is one of the when when young folks talk to me, especially these days, is they're swimming in a sea of possibilities or so great. And so that's another existential point, which is that we yearn for freedom. We react vigorously when we perceive that our choices have been curtailed and then we're paralyzed by indecision in the wake of seemingly unlimited possibilities because we're now choking on choice. And and I'm not sure if this is helpful advice or not, but what I say to folks is that the fact of the matter is, is that, you know, for most people, choice is a first world problem. And sometimes. The best option is to do something. As silly as it sounds, and then if that doesn't work, do something else, which just sounds like my mom torturing me when I was young. But, you know, part of the thing that I find myself singularly ill equipped. Is that where at that I may be at the tail end of the last generation of Americans where you I picked something and that's what you did. Like, I've been at a job for 40 years where you can expect to do better than your parents because those days are gone and where you can make a comfortable inference that the world in a decade or two will have any remote similarity to the one that we now inhabit. And so but still you recommend just do. Yeah. And to do so again, this is so back to the Heidegger guy because. All right. I mean, you know, I consider myself a professor, but what happens if most of the schools go out of business? Somebody else may consider themselves a restaurant tour, but what happens if there's no more restaurants? So what I this is negative advice. But I tell folks, don't define yourself. As a social caricature, yeah, don't don't limit. How you feel about yourself by through ID. With a host of variables that may be uncertain, maybe temporary and temporary, what not, but of course, that gets back to your point earlier, Lex, where you're like, yeah, but when you step out of that, it's extraordinarily discombobulating. So what I think you're talking about an axe of chopping wood, yeah, and soul from Socrates. Yeah. What is your soul what is the, uh, the essence of Shalane? Wow, that is like awesome, like when God when you when you show up at the end of this thing, he kind of looks at you, he's like, oh yeah, yeah, I remember you. Yeah. Well, you know, to be honest, what I muse about. Is. To me, the one. When people ask, I told you we have two kids of late 20s, early 30s and over the years. When people when we meet people that know our kids and they're like, oh, your kids are kind and decent, and I'd be like, that's what I would like. Because I think intelligence is vastly overrated. You know, the Unabomber was a smart guy and I do admire intelligence and I do venerate education and I find that to be. Tremendously important. But if I had to pay the ultimate homage to myself, it would be to be known as somebody who takes himself too seriously to take myself too seriously. Again, as corny as it sounds, I'd like to leave the world. A tad better than I found it, or at least do no harm. And I think I think you did all right. And that so in that regard, I love that question, that least that's a good one. I think everyone should be asked that. What is your soul deserve? Maybe just a few lingering questions around it. So, I mean, on the point of the soul, you've talked about the meaning of life of. On a personal level, do you have an answer to the meaning of your life, of something that brought you meaning happiness? Some. Some sense of sense. Yeah. No, I mean, yes, yes, sir, no, I mean, I you know, I'm 66, I'm in the kind of. Not ready to wrap it up literally or metaphorically, but you look I look back and just really with a sense of awe and wonder, gratitude. And is there memories that stand out to you from childhood, from earlier that like it's like, you know, stand out as something you're really proud of or. I'm just happy to have been on this earth making stuff happy. Yeah, that I mean, you know, my family also a chunk of my folks and my grandparents are from Eastern Europe, you know, Russia, Austria, as far as we know, some of them never made it out. I consider myself very fortunate to have. Then a so-called product of the American dream. You know, my grandparents are were basically peasants, my parents, my dad worked two full time jobs when I was growing up and I would see him on the weekends. I'd be like, why are you working all the time? He'd be like, So you won't have to. And he said, look, the world does not owe you a living. And so your first responsibility is to take care of yourself and then your next responsibility is to take care of other people. And I think he did a pretty good job of that. I don't know. But I had. So those are the things that I'm. Proud of. Well, it's funny, you've been you've talked about just yourself as a human being, but you've also contributed some really important ideas. For. Your ideas and also kind of integrating and maybe even popularizing the work of Ernest Becker, of connecting it, of making it legitimate scientifically, I mean, you know, as a human, of course you want to be you want your report to be one that makes the world a better place, but also, I think in the span of time. I think it's of great value well, you've contributed in terms of how we think about the human condition, how we think about ourselves as human, as finite beings in this world, and I hope also in our technology of engineering intelligence. I think, at least for me and I'm sure there's a lot of other people like me that your work has been a gift for, so. Well, thank you. Oh, I like that. We have described ourselves as giant into neurons, unlike we have had no original ideas. And maybe that's the only thing that's original about our work, is we don't claim to be original. What we claim to have done is to integrate and to connect these disparate and superficially unconnected discourses. You know, so existentialists, they'd be like evidence. What's that? And yeah, there's now a branch of psychology, experimental existential psychology that I think we could take credit for having encouraged the formation of. And that, in turn has gotten these ideas in circulation and academic communities where they may not have otherwise gotten. So I think that's good. Oshun is a huge honor. I can't believe you came down here. I've been a fan of your work. I hope we get to talk again, Hugi to talk to you. Thank you so much for talking today. Thanks. We'll do it again soon, I hope.

#100 – Alexander Fridman: My Dad, the Plasma Physicist, The following is a conversation with Alexander Friedman, he's a professor at Drexel University and the director of the Nine Plasma Institute. He's one of the top plasma physicist and plasma chemists in the world. And most importantly to me, he's my dad. Plasma, by the way, is not referring to blood plasma in biology, but to the fourth state of matter in physics, solid liquid gas and plasma, which is a gas of charged particles that behaves in fascinating ways. Plasma makes up the sun, the stars, lightening plasma displays, fluorescent lamps and is the most common state of matter in the universe. This is the one hundredth episode of this podcast. There were quite a few very big conversations, which were all options, but I decided to go back to where it all started for me and to do a personal conversation with my dad. This was a difficult conversation for me for many reasons. But life is short. Perhaps who needed microphones to give us a chance to say the things we never would have said otherwise? This is that conversation. This is also a chance to briefly look back. If you don't know. I stepped down from my full time position at MIT to pursue a dream of building a startup around A.I. systems that form meaningful connections with human beings. I didn't have much money. The videos I've made and this podcast was a way to try to pay for food and rent while taking on the startup journey. It also gave me a chance to have conversations with people who inspire me, who make me think, and to share it with an amazing community. Frankly, I don't know what to do with the idea that this thing has been listened to 35 million times. I'm pretty sure most of those are iPods. But if you're one of the rare biological systems listening to this. Thank you. I feel the love. It gives me a lot of strength in both this and the startup. By the way, since some people asked my full very Russian birth name is Alexei, Aleksi or Alyosha or as my mom might say, Yushchenko, but I've always enjoyed all my friends and people close to me who call me Leks or Lex in English. A few folks and companies donated money and sponsored this podcast. And they're the reasons I'm here. The best way you can support me in this journey is to support the sponsors. Please do. I only do ads here in the intro and not in the middle. For me as a fan, mineral ads get in the way of the conversation. Maybe I'm wrong about that. Wouldn't be the first time. Please click on the sponsored links in the description, sign up, download, buy whatever they're selling. That really is the best way to support the journey. I'm on a quick summary of the ads.

I'm an AI researcher and engineer first and foremost, but I see as much bigger than any one technical or scientific field. I see it as our journey to understand and engineer the mind, to explore the nature of intelligence, consciousness, human behavior, the fabric of the universe that gifted us the triumph and the tragedy of the human condition without telling us, except for a few hints here and there about the meaning of it all. I will talk to roboticists and philosophers, physicists and historians, mathematicians and astronauts and maybe even political leaders always returning to the technical, which is home for me, but also not being afraid to venture out into the messy human world. I honestly don't know how long I'll be doing this podcast. Life is full of surprises, but for at least a short while, I hope you join me on this journey. And thank you for coming along this far. This conversation is supported by the Jordan Harbin's Your Show. Find it on Apple podcast Spotify. Wherever you listen to podcast or click the Jordan Harbinger dot com slash subscribe link in the description. I've been bingeing on it. Jordan's awesome. He gets the best out of his guests, dives deep, calls them out when it's needed and makes the whole thing fun to listen to. His conversations with Kobe Bryant, Neil deGrasse Tyson are good examples of that. One part I remember listening to is Neil talking with Jordan about fountain pens and how it brings you closer to the words you're communicating outside of interviews. Jordan is also just inspiring, pragmatic, giving a solid, no B.S. life advice, which is a nice complement to what I ramble on about in this podcast, which can include things like ajai quantum field theory or whether neural networks can ever truly understand language. I'm not sure if any of that gives you actionable life advice. So search and listen to the Jordan. Just show an Apple podcast, Spotify. Give them some love. Tell them I sent you. This episode is supported by magic spoon, low carb, keto friendly, delicious cereal. I've been in the mix, as you might know, of Kiddo and Carnivore Diet for a very long time now. That means eating very little carbs. I used to love cereal. Obviously, most cereals have crazy amounts of sugar, which is terrible for you. So I quit years ago. A magic spoon is a totally new thing. Zero sugar, 11 grams of protein and only three grams of carbs. It tastes delicious and honestly, way too good to be true. I use it to celebrate a good training session like the push ups and pull ups challenge up and ramping up for it has four flavors coco, fruity, frosted and blueberry. I tried all of them. They're all delicious. But if you know what's good for you, you'll go with Coco, my favorite flavor and the flavor of champions.

And now here's my conversation with my dad, Alexander Friedman. What to you is the most beautiful idea in physics, chemistry or mathematics? Oh, let's go to that place first before we go to the. To Kiev are the most beautiful in physics, chemistry, I would say, I would say Einstein, his ideas regarding stochastic motion and Brownian motion, I think it is the most beautiful, clear, simple idea, because from this, like a stochastics, you can prove the existence of molecules or not. It was I think it was his first publication in 05 with his first wife. Actually, it was significantly already. That's right, they were collaborators. Those five, four, four or five papers published. Yeah, actually almost everything which Einstein did. It was published. But the most important stuff he published in one year, one nine five. Mm hmm. But the first idea was. Probably the most elegant can you describe Brownian motion and why you think it's beautiful? You see that people at that time? They understand that if molecules if they exist, their motion is absolutely chaotic. Mm hmm. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. What he proved that doesn't matter what size of particles is. Their motion is similar and about the same. So it is not necessary to see molecules. You can look at the bigger particles, like if you smoke, there is particles and you can see like a propagation of this smoke and from here. Determine behavior of molecules, and that's actually a relatively short. Very elegant, very clear. And at that point, people they kept talking about molecules, but it was no proof because there is no like a super electron microscope to see them. So, you know, I'm saying, yes, molecules exist. Who said, well, I mean, can you show me that? So I made it. And boop. And he proved that a lot of people after these publications that. Probably molecules really exist, Einstein, 19 or five, so what do you like about that idea? The is an implicit simplicity that's proving something very, very, very, very, very, very complicated. So if I ask you, for example, you know, molecules exist, can you prove it? Mm hmm. Obviously, like now you would say, OK, I have a special electronic microscope and I can take a look. That's OK. But when you go back to the beginning of 20th century. People, they were laughing, can you prove something you cannot read? No, no, no. Take a look at something very simple. Very, very simple. Very, very simple. What do you think it takes to do that? Kind of. Thinking and competitive ideas and how many times have you encountered those kinds of ideas in your life? Have you had any. Yeah, yeah, I would say. And that's that's the whole beauty. My feeling that's a whole bit of science is just, you know, people, they say, no, no, no, no, it's impossible or no, no. Take a look. Take a look. Wait a second. I need to take a look. Just think for five minutes if something is very complicated. You know, Kapisa, Nobel Prize laureate, like I work with him, by the way, he used to say, if it is complicated, it's probably wrong. Well, it was a lot of discussion on Capitol Hill and now. Because now he he enjoyed to do something in a most complicated way. Why his friend Capitán, he was trying to do everything is an absolutely simple. And they had all these discussions because sometimes Capitol Hill went to extremes and he used to say. Well, this is simple, it means this is right and he was like, OK, you mean that everything was simple is right? I mean, like Feynman to you, like the simple. Yes, yes, yes, yes. And that's the whole point to find this simplicity. That's that's the beauty of science. That's a beauty, really. That's beautiful. That's something worth to do. Like at the risk of going religious for a second. Why do you think our universe allows for such simplicity to be discovered that such simplicity exists at all? I can I can tell you it is very similar to Darwin's theory. Why, I don't know why animals are this way, not the other way. So it is actually competition. Take a look about simplicity in beauty of physics, like you have two interacting planets and the force is proportional to one over R-squared. In this case, they are able to go in circles or analysis if there is another law. They are either falling or without. So, like, so if, like, our solar system exists, so just the interaction would be over our square. That's it. It's very interesting about Isaac Newton and his way of thinking that's also was super, I would say genius. Is it weird to you, talking about Newton, that action a distance, for example, the stuff I was doing in elementary school, which is funny without any knowledge of physics, but I was doing physics because of fighting, throwing things. Oh, better than that. Better than that. We played. Well, it was third, second, third grade. So it's in 1962, 1963. So from one hand, you know, Kiff that time. So people they were excited about was obviously always especially boys. And also, you know, we are way better than Americans because, you know, we have four Sputnik. Yeah. And and Gagarin. I remember how happy we were. When was Gagarin? What year do you remember? Oh, I'm afraid to make a mistake, but I think it's in 1961 or 1960. 1961, 1962. Because what I remember that I wasn't either in the first grade or second grade and it was no, believe me or not at the time was a big problem because of Khrushchev and the coverage of shortage of bread shortage, all kinds of food. No potatoes. No, it was a mistake, actually, of Russia because when he came to America, he saw that corn is everywhere. And he decided that if he put enough corn in Russia, Russia will be way stronger from the point of agriculture in America and that he overdid it. As a result, it was a shortage of wheat. So that's why I remember this moment, so just for kids. You remember so yes. So for kids, what else is on each day? Yeah, during the class, you know, the special guy used to come and give a small piece of white bread to each kid, white bread, white bread, and at the same time like a teacher. And I was, wow, I forgot about this guy. Went to the space and kids, they even forgot about this, the bread. So that's how big of a moment it is. It's more importantly, I get back to take a look. If you are a boy, you think about this single space like a one half of boys. They want to be astronauts, cosmonauts or the USA and the other half wanted to design rockets. So I was from this second part, so myself, with friends, we start designing small rockets. To fight second grade. Second grade, second, third, second, third grade, and we have been fighting with these guys from our next door house because these idiots, they used to use only stones against us. Well, and it was a big fence. Between houses, soldiers, they throw stones and we decided to make rockets. Well, we made it and a scientist was born engineer, too. Yes, it was both science and engineering. Well, let me ask, was it that moment or in general, when did you first fall in love with science? I would say a sense I think clearly this fight with these beds, there is there are the kids with which keep throwing stones. From another side of the fence. Mm hmm. And we start making rockets. What does it mean? The rocket as the fuel? We use a mixture of photographic films with special chemicals. You know, we consulted with. Is a voice from high school, how about some details and we made it more or less, and then it was that stuff was actually wrapped into the silver foil. And in the end, we put like a match. So it was another match. We liked it. And this stuff was going like sometimes 10 meters. Yeah. And it was able to go like two meters high. But very often it was mistakes because, like, we are bad with stability. So what I try to calculate at this moment is like a trajectory. Hmm. Stability. Meaning while it's in the air. Yeah. Control probably. Yes. Yes. Control. So I try to try to calculate what motion to describe the where to point it. So we have to point it to be sure that it will go far enough and it will go above the defense, which was maybe one meter eighty or something like that. So so what was most interesting to the calculations or the math or physics or calculating the trajectory or the fact that you could engineer build something that's based on science in in the beginning, in the beginning and the beginning? To be honest, I was happy to fight. This is my side of the fence. Yeah. Which was funny that we used to do that and and they kept throwing stones. Which actually you cannot prove anything, but then in the end of this period, actually I fall in love with. Science, what is science to you sort of in that period, your eight year old or 15? Events, so not just to throw a stone, but just to make something and just and take a look, we made it so the the the creation. Yeah. And also another important stuff when you are doing this kind of stuff for your friends. They start. Thinking that you are not so bad, you know, oh, so it's a way to earn respect your credit on the playground. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We were not interested in girls. You know, when you are like a second third grade, we just we hated girls. Yeah. But it was very important to have a respect from. Yeah. From always. Right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's the camaraderie and your feeling and secret from parents and just to linger on it because you brought up Gagarin. Yeah. What are your thoughts. You know, it's inspired on the American side. The Apollo missions inspired an entire generation of scientists. What was your thought about Gagarin and the space race and how they made you feel? What role did it play in your life? To be honest, the whole country had a huge respect. To Gagarin, he was a nice person, very simple, and he was a hero because, you know, to be first to go to the space, knowing that percentage of success at the time with dogs was way far from 100 percent. It's a big deal, I would not say that it inspired like a sound science. No, it did not. Back to making rockets. It was just interesting and about America. We are way better than America. That's the way we have been thinking. I mean, come on. Is that. Yeah, that's not a question. Yeah. Uh, in America, saying the same as propaganda was it's propaganda. But keep in mind, very, very important, actually. At that time in this year, Russia was way ahead, yeah, but it was no NASA. That's right. That's so the fact that Russia is way ahead is what motivated America to really step it up. And from one hand, but from another hand for Russian kids of second grade and third grade. Mm hmm. Come on. We didn't think about America. That's like, you know, that's millions of miles away. Yeah. Besides physics, you also have poetry in your blood. So what has been your relationship to poetry? Music? What role did it play in your life? Poetry is a lot, but it is way later. Then then elementary school, actually. Like music wise, you know, like all teenagers, they're in love with music and it's just exactly the same now and 20 years ago and 30 years ago, I would say. At that time and that time, we were all in love with one special group, which is. And he and what was extremely later, I was in sixth grade, fifth grade or the 60, 64, 65, 66. And in Soviet Union, Bidle, they were forbidden village smallmouth. It was absolutely strange, but at the same time, if something is forbidden, that's exactly what you love most. So I remember that for my big successes in science, I was awarded with going to the best of the best Kamps pioneer camps, Artec in Crimea. And over there, it was it's international, so I met with I live together with a group of people from France. Yeah. Because I was the only one kind of speaking fluently in French and we just made trade. So we gave whatever we used to have. And we got the Beatles records, Beatles records and go, that's the rebellion you're a part of. What about poetry? What when did you first I mean, you've written a lot. I wrote what? What poet. What maybe. Do you remember an early poem you've written? A bad one. A good one. No, I started doing that late. So it was I was in seventh grade. I think that's late writing poetry. I thought and writing poetry is a little bit related to when boys they start looking at girls. It was a little bit different ice. And we just love somehow behind poets even not so much even laugh, even just just all this imagination. Right? Like a way far from reality. It's an it is romanticism. Were you a serious poet or funny because you have a lot of humor and with Deadpool it's later. Yeah, but that time as was extremely serious. Yeah. And extremely romantic. Which never ever after that it is hard to imagine. Yeah. But it is kind of a little bit like a childish romanticism or childish. I mean you know that but. But it was it's interesting enough that the first poetry was actually almost immediately from my very good. It's not like, you know, you are doing something not good and then better and then better and then better. It's actually the opposite best stuff, which I wrote. It was like a seventh grade, well, around more like an eighth and ninth grade. And I wrote a lot at the time. Why do you think you were so what does it mean? What good is good poetry mean? That means it's not cheesy. It's beautifully worded. And he crafted it. Yes. And so where did that come from? Was most people even great poets are terrible at first. So why why were you so clever quickly? Because most people know you as really funny. Clever? No, I mean good words. Very, very good words. So you're saying that was early on. You already had that? Yes. I have no good answer. Just. Comes from nowhere. Yeah, from my dad. Oh, no, no, it wasn't Zirkin, I was it was actually, to be honest, no, not so much connection. But in Russian culture, romanticism, it is extremely important element, you know, starting from 19th century romanticism. So, yes, it was very popular. So either you are writing with poetry or bad poetry or you are an artist. You are like a, you know, painting something. So I have a lot of friends say they were painting. Mm hmm. Do you remember poetry? Do you remember a poem from that time that you've written by any chance? Yeah, sure. I remember most of them by her mind. You mind reciting there in Russian? Russian is good as long as they're not in French. I have in French. If you want me just to read what what do you think what what's comfortable. You know, maybe I will read one to one poem. Mm hmm. Which I like most from that period, and I'm not sure that I wrote something better after that. Well, it's a little bit cheesy, however, but not much. It's like a it's even not about girls. It's about music. Hmm. But still, the romantic, romanticized kind of wisdom, very Strong Medicine Act was the result of me reading a book by Eugenia Kitamura. Hysteria bitching about Captain Maestre, you're going to Crysler, actually, the story of a cat who found a book or like a notebook, but the notebook. Of people. He started reading about that and analyzing their life. So it's a life of peace through the eyes of a very, very smart cat. So then I can read it in Russian, right? I mean, this Poythress once, please. I'll be going, OK? Well, it is one of them Crysler hypochlorite as well as Kapellmeister Ülgen Chrysler Büyük Placates. You wouldn't give us the billions he needs with Rajkovic. Never notice any Sodertalje American like the one who died in the Miramichi opportunities. Peter Snork Soon. Quiñonez Mouratidis New Graterford Tolkan. You smoke. Israeli society, Palestinian rocket Kushel Real has occupied the region all through the economy, lipase creepily schmiel if Suddeutsche scores Crevecoeur slow a yearly Clarkesville Nadene dawn donator, not Eurail Apparels Smith Nadhmi from senior Woori it across the casselberry piles. Go nationally lasering responses from them Christly if Associated Press release kapellmeister Chrysler with placards labels. Wow, that's good. And it's like a I would say that whatever I did later, it was. How old were you? The here. So seventh grade. So eighth grade. Eighth grade 15. That is that's very good. Yeah. And it's a that's the romanticism, you know, with a little bit of like it too much. It's musically cheesiness I would say, but very strong. So let's go let's go to Kiev. OK, let's go to Kiev. You were born and raised in Kiev, just like you said, with the guys, with the rocks and the rockets. And but it was the stupid guys, you know, I guess we already got that you can hold a grudge. What are some memories of your dad and mom that stand out and OK, what we do. Well, let's drink in Japanese, so. Yeah, what are we drinking, Japanese whiskey and Japanese whiskey. They call it from the Barrel. We're not sponsored by nickel. Whiskey, good whiskey. Uh, yeah, we do not, but they are very, very good. Yep. Yeah. And they are in support of its, uh, Hokkaido north of Japan. So they are doing good beer, which is ZAPORA. They good very good whiskey and a lot of red caviar can make sure that's it. Did you ever think when you were uh that shortage of bread and you were doing the rocket, that you would be sitting here in America a few years later drinking Japanese whiskey? We talking about caviar? Did you even know what caviar was? Oh, no, no. Obviously, because caviar, it was for holidays a little bit and it was distributed. It's not like you go and buy it, but you got it a little bit like a small can. So we all of us, we knew that. And it just it was very popular. And. Well, let me just actually ask that question. How did you imagine what where you would be 50 years from then? How did you think about your future? Actually. Oh, like in about eight grades, nine grades, I was very, very, very, very, very, very good in physics, mathematics and chemistry. So I was actually in this system of like Olympiada so-called competition. I was absolutely No. One in Ukraine twice an absolute number two. The Soviet Union also twice. This is physics, competition or mathematics. It was physics. So for people who don't know, maybe you can explain. I mean, this is still goes on to this day. These are very intense competitions. I don't know if they're that popular in the United States, probably because the United States folks don't do as great. But there it is, extremely popular, but not physics. What is going on in this country? I was very much impressed. It's a very serious and very tough competition in mathematics, in math, that's right. In physics class. Biology class. So you already know new summit in eighth grade that you're very good at. Yes. But wait a minute. You said chemistry to chemistry or physics? Chemistry and you competed you won in Ukraine. And I was number two in Soviet Union was twice now. Very interesting that in Soviet Union it was a rule you supposed to choose so you can participate in this competition in physics, mathematics and chemistry and all three of them up to the level of championship of the region of the big city. Mm hmm. In my case, it was Kiev. But then to go to competition in the Ukraine, you have to choose. You can go to only to one. Hmm, so I want physics and chemistry and mathematics in Kiev, then I choose physics and I was going to Ukrainian. Now if you win in Ukraine, so couple of people from the whole Ukraine goes to this championship of. Soviet Union, that's an incredible accomplishment, by the way, was incredible. It was I mean, you basically you you peaked in terms of physics and poetry at age 14. That's a big difference. You know, in physics, I was really on top of the Soviet Union, which is a huge country in poetry. It was just. At nine, I'm not a professional, you know, and you can't compete in Porgera. Yeah, well, basically over there and gold medal from high school, what you call here valedictorian, which is hard to do. And I would say here is also very the independent high school. But in Kiev, it was an interesting situation because you have to the most difficult was actually not physics, mathematics, and it was writing, but because it was writing, not on the computer without spellcheck. It just and you have to write how to win with miss, you know, 12, 12. Pages as a minimum of an essay, and it's supposed to be zero mistakes and the Russian language is not the easiest one. And when you say mistakes, I mean, this is a grammar mistake. It's not just its grammar, its writing mistakes, too. Oh, no. I mean, the writing is just incorrect use of words or something. Can you cross stuff out? No, this is the you can't make a mistake in the actual writing process. You're writing with a pen. Yeah. And cursive. You're not supposed to make any direction and you're not allowed to cross the lines. And that's it's perfection in in all the way. And it's silly. But maybe. What do you think about that. Is it what, what do you think about that strictness? Because it it it's easy to criticize from a distance, but there's something powerful about it. Yes, there is. And you know what? Countries are more powerful from this point of view is Japan is Petrakis. I was so much impressed with their kids. What they keep saying that in Japan for kids. It doesn't matter, it's a holiday or a weekend or whatever. Each day you're supposed to train with these Japanese characters because if not, it's just impossible just to remember it. So they're there working too hard. But as a result, they can see for them quality because quality means no mistakes. Right. That's a very interesting point. What is new quality, it means no. Perfectionism. And this perfectionism creates this kind of risk. Yeah, which this is what perfect tastes like. It's interesting. I mean, it forces you to take education seriously, everything seriously like this. This craftsmanship, its craftsmanship. Seriously. Yes, yes. Yes. And, you know, I mentioned to you this exam, this exam in in Russian essay, but it was something which was worse than that. Yeah, because because it was Kiev. We supposed to take two essays, one in Russian language and also in Ukrainian language. So I think for a second it's a it's not your native language. And you're supposed to also write this at least 12 pages without with zero mistakes. And without any possibility to make any it should be perfect as a result, was funny that I speak Ukrainian, not bad at all. Because of this, I wouldn't say it's a good idea, but it's it's kind of a Russian version of a version of of a Japanese story. But yeah, you know, there's a lot of interesting other things. I get to memorize poetry here, to memorize things, which I mean, that's a really interesting access. That's what probably you remember. Yeah. Though it still was there when I was there. Yeah. Yeah. Like I used to know at least. Thousand points by heart, by heart, and you still remember many of your own by heart. Yeah, his, by the way, helps with mathematics. How good memory? Just memory. OK, so you said you already knew. I mean, it's an incredible, incredible accomplishment to be at that level in physics at that young age. So what did you think about the future, returning to the original question, where do you think that would take you? This fascination and this skill with physics? Did you imagine I being a professor, did you imagine being Einstein? You know, kids in high school, I mean, at least between us and I was like already in high school. It was like special high school and physics and mathematics. We were all like not only dreaming, but being sure. We can do that, we can be best of the best in the world, and and it was a very popular subject at that time, if you are like the best thing in physics, it's way more you are way more popular than a guy who is the best in basketball. Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, that's what do you think that is in the Soviet Union, that it was so respected. So admired when you were great at science, it was propaganda. So is the state created there? Yes, so and it was good actually. Do you think we'll ever see that in America without an authoritarian in a democracy? Because in America, Brad Pitt and Michael Jordan are the superstars and scientists. Most people don't know a single scientist except Einstein in America. Well, I would say my feeling it should happen in America. It should happen to the boys and girls in America. It should be should meaning like that's a good thing. Or should you think it's very important? Because if. If. Kids in America, they are just not so much good in sciences. Sooner or later, we will lose competition. To two countries where science is in very much high prestige example today, unfortunately, not Russia. The best example today is probably China. I have been there. I saw their high schools. Have to be very careful with that. So my feeling that that it should be done because in America, university education is way stronger than in Russia. Mm hmm. And is way stronger than in Europe. But high school education in America is not so. So strong. It is difficult to understand why, but what do you think the universities are so strong in America? Why do you think the most Nobel Prizes are from America? Why do you think science is so good, even though, yeah, scientists were never really worshipped in America because in Russia it was always a problem. So the strongest you know, the people, students, kids, they they're they are very hard workers when they are in high school, because after that there is a very strong competition to get the good university. Very, very, very challenging, the same in China. So you have to be very good to enter a very good university. So kids, they work like crazy to do that. Also, boys, they knew that they have to take a look. You have one chance in most cases, with the exception of a couple of universities, have only one chance to go to one university to try yourself. If you make it, you become a student. If not, you go to the army for three years. So you it's very interesting, it's a very psychologically interesting situation, because what is going on, you have to make a decision by yourself. Are you strong enough to go to the best place? Mm hmm. Because it's only one place you can go. Now they start changing the system. But in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s, it was the case. So just and there was a cost because of failing. Once you choose and you don't get in cost, not money wise, but real cost, you go to Ironmen if you are a boy. If you if you just overestimate yourself. Mm hmm. Is that when you got that line in your hair, that that period when you talk to people who don't know my dad's hair now is white, but he used to have the sexy straight down the middle for many decades. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 10, 20, 30. A lot of pictures. I have this right now anymore. Not anymore. It's a good look now. So anyway, is that when you got a distress that's when you were under the stress was it was a real stress. What happened? Well, that's that's the best story. I told you that in when I was a finishing high school at the 10th grade. At the time, I became a champion of Ukraine, number one and second in Soviet Union, which was a very, very big deal. After that, five kids and six No. Five, five kids from Soviet Union were supposed to go to international competition. Mm hmm. And this international competition was the same dates as, you know, exams to enter university. So if you are a champ, if you are making five best five best kids in physics, five best kids in mathematics, five best kids in whatever chemistry they. Were able to skip. This final exams. Which means to keep this essay in language, one language is say another language, and you skip all exams, but instead of death, you prepare for international competition. Mm hmm. So because I was number two, I was clearly the team. So I was not supposed to go to this stupid exams, right? And butwell, but it was this telephone call of our leader from Moscow, and he said that like it's like a one week before. But unfortunately, you have to be replaced with another guy because they are unable to give you a visa. Oh, and that was actually that's that was the stress. It was it was a very big stress. And at that point, like people, including those from America and Zionist motion, and they came to me and they asked me, you know, to make a speech and just to say something and to do something. And they took my dad to your grandfather. He spoke with people from KGB because he was a guy, had them and and he came to me and said, OK, you do whatever you want because it's your life. You make a decision. But they told me that if you. Forget about what happened. You have a gold medal which is over there. He'll pass all exams and you will have a five and a highest grade, whatever you do, it will be a yea and then you go to any university you want. And you'll be accepted. Mm hmm. This is KGB talking, those kinds of things. Yeah, and I hesitated. I said, well, yeah, I agree, I, I will not fight against the system. So can you explain a little bit? Does you being Jewish have anything to do with it? Absolutely. It's 100 percent OK. So because it was actually it was a 1970. And in this moment, it was a very significant actually push to immigration for Jewish people, to Israel and to America. And they they were afraid all this that they just give all this award to the guy and he will say, OK, guys, goodbye. I just decide to go to America or to Germany or whatever of Israel keeping that in mind just in case they prefer not to give Visa. And the time, interesting enough is KGB. So they do not give a visa and they do not give any explanation why. Right. Just. You cannot do that, however, however, they say he's a good guy and if he accepts. That will do everything for him. Dunsford. It's also a risk because you never know they can, but I don't know, maybe, maybe I am so smart, but actually without special preparation, I went to the super exams. And they got a you did well, I did well, so and that's the reason of the strike, which appeared in a very short. It was a source of stress, but I'm not exactly understanding the depth of the stress it was. Did you have a choice to make? I mean, it doesn't feel like there's a choice. It just actually went already. I made a decision. I was already resistant. OK, so the decision process was because I was it's like, you know, I was falling from Olympe or whatever, like because I was feeling that everything is like I'm best of the best in the world or whatever and boots they actually put me in my place. You know, it was a difficult moment, but but then I was accepted and it wasn't, you know, immediately celebration because, you know, I got this gold medal, which is a big deal. And Soviet Union, the gold medal represents being about the Toyia proletarian right. So. Did you experience anti-Semitism leading up to that moment in your life, did you feel that you were were you made to feel that you were Jewish? Did you experience life as a as a Ukrainian Jew or simply as a Ukrainian? And also for the listener, that is uncomfortable talk A likes to avoid uncomfortable conversations, so I have to force them into uncomfortable conversations. OK, oh, well, it's not only me, just like all our generation are in at that time in Ukraine, in Ukraine, Ukraine. At that time, it was not the same as Ukraine today. So level of anti-Semitism. It was way higher in Ukraine than in other places, other Soviet republics. All right. Why is that? Is there any historical. Yes. Reason for that? Well, it was actually historical, significant historical reasons, starting from Bogdan Netsky. So at some point, a couple of hundred years before that, Jews, they supported Polish people and it was against Russia, against Ukraine. So just a level of anti-Semitism was very high in in these kind of countries. Also, this area was inside of pale of settlement. So there was a lot of Jews, a lot of Jews, a lot of problem with Jews in Moscow. It was forbidden for Jews to leave. So no no Jews, no problems. So when I actually moved from Kiev to Moscow, it is like a day and night. So Moscow was beautiful. I mean, I did not feel well, if you felt. But not not so much. I would say in Ukraine always I felt that I am Jewish. But from that hand, you remember all these kids from our yard were like a stone that that both both groups, they were Jewish. So what I'm trying to say that Jews, they lived actually together. So from that point of view, you know, it's less it's a huge anti-Semitism. But but they are somewhere you're somewhat isolated from it because because it's like a Jewish Jew getting together. I mean, they just it was a historical ghetto. Yeah. OK, let's let's jump back. OK, we were saying that you were born and raised in Kiev. What what are your favorite or maybe most representative memories of your dad and mom? From the earlier years. Well. It was a. Beautiful family. You're the only chance, you're just I was only charged one, yes. And my father, he was a hero of World War Two and he was actually always with a stick because, you know, he was like a cane. Cane, right. He was heavily wounded during the war and he operated the gun, the machine gun. He knows he's got a very complicated situations. Also, he was risking his life enormously. And the only reason he survived because he was heavily wounded soldiers. It was the end of the war for him. And, you know, and as a boy, you know, for me, he was and he was a real hero. He was like, you know, it's not very different from me. He's like a big hands, you know, like, yes, always. He was not drinking Japanese whiskey. He was drinking only one thing. Mm hmm. What do you remember? Like we had somewhere else? Yeah. Well, we'll get to the bar. Yeah, but what I'm trying to say that it's a different personality. And he just from this Jewish boy, he became an associate minister. Of construction of Ukraine, which was a very big deal, so he was like, this is very much different from me. I'm like a little bit like a softer personality, much like my mother. But he was a very tough guy. Yeah. Were you afraid of them? Whom would have to be afraid he he loved me, but he was a person like, you know, very strong personality. So, yes, when if I did something wrong. Oh, you remember the story? No, no. I mean, with these idiots from another. From the right. Yeah. And it's OK. It's so yes. I was afraid of my father, so I had huge respect. And my mother, she was like a nice Jewish mother. And I said, well, let me kind of ask a hard question. You've lost your dad a few years ago. Yeah. What did it feel like when you learned that he died? What went through your head? What memories? Well, like, you know, losing your parents, it's. It's when your parents so I would say what I can say to Susan Sarandon and my father, it was a whole generation. You know, this is just like. And, you know, the feeling you have that now you are the man. That's interesting. But the feeling is. Now it's my turn to be great. I just have to do something now just because when you have your parents, you always have this feeling that there is something behind you just in case. Yeah. And my father, he was very, very, very strong personality. Just this interesting story that during this, uh, persecution in 1952 by Stalin, when it was the so-called affair of doctors or whatever, how to say in English deliberately, when Jewish people were actually sad, just their doctors and most of them were Jewish, basically. So they used to say that they actually kill half of the government, whatever, as a doctors. It was absolutely lie. It just says nothing was reality. And Jews, they were prepared actually to be moved from all over the Soviet Union to Abidjan to make a close to Chinese border on Amort River like, oh, it's thought they tried to move them closer to Japan, the Japanese whiskey. So, like in camps. No, watch. Just just just just kind of moved them so they would talk to the so-called Jewish oblasts, Jewish region or whatever. But it's like it was nothing there. Yeah. And if you move like this kind of group of people with about three million Jews, not to forget, you know, at least half will die just during this movie. So it was nothing. And you're preventing them from having a future. Yeah. So at that time, you know, people they kept start kept talking about the same stupid stuff that Jews, they drink blood of babies, of Christian babies. Yeah. And and that's what my father used to say, that his friends. And it's like a. it's like a meeting and the, you know, people they're asking, have you seen something? Have you seen him like a drinking glass or something like that? And he said that he was absolutely impressed that his friends and all of them, they most of them in. There or either leaving the room just not to participate in this stupidity or they say we haven't seen, but who knows if people they write in newspapers. It's a very strong propaganda so that he lost he was associate director of this manufacturing plant. And I and they say that he's supposed to leave. Because because this whole propaganda, he's a Jew and Jews are drinking the blood of Christian babies, maybe, maybe, who knows, maybe it's enough, but there's no evidence that they're not. Yes, right. So so he's not going to prison, but he's not going to work in our enterprise. So he said, OK, I am like associate director and I want to be a worker, simplest doctor because I love my plants. No. So actually he left and it was what was that memory stand out for you. Why? Because it was it was 1952 and I was born in 1953. So. So what was happening? That he was without a job for one year because nobody wanted to to take him before Stalin died in 1953. And it was a moment when I was born. So my mother, she worked to support the whole family. And we lived in a small room, 14 square meters. It was my grandmother, grandfather, father, mother and me. So, I mean, that's kind of it was a big impact on. And then Stalin died and everything became way better is and in terms of anti-Semitism as well. Oh, you see, there is a good movie basically made here in America, a Russian Jews part, the Russian Jews parturition. There are three. I think it's on YouTube. Yeah. So what is that? It was almost no antisemitism before World War Two, but it was very strong and it isn't. After the end of the World War two and in nineteen forty five and death of Stalin in 1953, in 1953, serration become better but not as good way, not as good as in the 1930s. Why was there anti-Semitism after the war? The Second World War, it seems, on Russia. Sorry to interrupt. How did the Russians in your memory think about the the the cruelty of the Holocaust? Because there's so much pride about Russia winning the war of being the you know, to getting to Berlin isn't. How do you think about the people that were tortured? Well, we had a very strong, very strong propaganda propaganda, very strong propaganda. So what happened that OK, what actually happened? That in the end of OK, before World War Two? Before World War Two? Actually, Jewish people, they just they forgot that their Jews it was and I mean, they were all Soviet, you know, like the Soviet first, Soviet first way first. I mean, it was before war in the end of the war. Jewish people, they create a lot of special organizations. And because of Holocaust, they had significant support of the United States of America and the Western countries, but mostly United States of America and Jewish people. In the end of World War Two, they start thinking that it's like my story was this when I graduated from high school. So they start believing that they are the guys, you know, because they have so much support from the United States. And it's also an on top of that, like a chariot was a creation of Israel. And that was around then, so and I night there was a kind of a push that Jews are no longer Soviets state their homeland is. Yes. And and Jews, they felt like a initially very nice, but they overdid it. So bottom line, it was a and also not to forget about Hitler. So as a result, a level of anti-Semitism in from 1945, the 19th, 53 was growing significantly and then it was a little bit better. But actually significant improvements are happening on the 1960s, not earlier than that. So can you talk a little bit more about your dad's journey in World War Two? I mean, there's I remember a bunch of stories, but, you know, just for people interested in, you know, it's a World War two, is that the core of our family in a sense? So can you just linger and maybe if you have memories about his impact, how did he get injured? What was his relationship with the, you know, violence, with death, with bullets flying everywhere? Yeah. On my father, he was born in 1923, so in my end, where I live in Minsk, in Minsk, which is now with Russia, and and he was born in October. So when the Cold War started, he was 17. Yeah. And it was forbidden to go to Army if you are younger than 18. So together with his friends, they may change in the past, but they just change their year from they made themselves one year older just to be accepted to the army. And interesting enough that, like the way I understand at least this, the people who organized like a army, they understand they saw that this boys, they're younger, but. They letting go. He wanted to go what he wanted to go. You know, there's so many stories in the Vietnam War in America where there's there's a lot of people, brave people, who found ways to not go. Yeah. Here it's absolutely opposite. It's absolutely apposite because most not not everybody would disagree, but majority propaganda was extremely strong. So protecting your father and mother, it's even to die for your country. Yes, yes. Yes. So to die for your country, it was kind of like an honor. Yeah, that's. And also, they were sure that Red Army is 100 times stronger than these Germans. Yeah. So and they thought that, OK, we'll go there. So a couple of months and we are winners, but in one way or another. But they were all wanted to go, especially when, you know, you're not like a very rich guy, you know. So he went to the army and it was like a couple of months special preparation to become like a lowest level of officers. So junior lieutenants or whatever it is in this country. And he became like this low level officer and he starts actually near Moscow and just start going back and back and back and back and and that's it. And he was with this machine gun. Mm hmm. And, you know, the change of like that was very fast. So people they were killed very, very, very fast, actually. People that were operating machine guns. Yeah, very, very fast. Because just change the change over the change. Like, so he became division commander reasonably fast division the region. That's one way to move up when everybody's dying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And what he kept saying, I think, given to you, because he just it was like he kept saying that for some reason he was absolutely sure that every day he saw that like everybody else are killed and he's not. So he was kind of sure that something's protecting him. He's invincible and, yes, he's invincible. He he wasn't right and he was very strong, actually, very, very, very strong, like basically physically and mentally, physically and mentally. So kind of like he looks I mean, he's like because that's silly, but not like myself. But he's very physically strong and mentally. Protected, like I don't know what the best way to say that he's he was assuring himself and he was sure that there's a confidence. Is that the idea? No, no, no, it's not. It's a confidence. It's a concept a little bit like a kind of like a religious. But he did not believe to the guy in the first place, but he believed in what he used to say in his star. So there is a star which protects him. And I'd be right, and he might be right. He survived the war he had he survived the war because after like four, not like five or six months, he was heavily wounded, which was very good. Yeah, actually, because that's right. He's right in the leg. In the leg. Yeah. So he was like and he had a lot of this. Or do you remember what about the people in general, you know, 20 million plus Soviet people died. Yeah. What impact do you remember what impact the war had on the people? So enormous. Enormous. That's why for 20 million, it is a lot. And half of them were just civilians. Because Stalin, he just operated this war without counting people. Yeah, but do you think it had. Powerful creative impact in terms of music, art, literature, science, for the sad thing about war. All of the above science mostly. All of the above it, because even before war, science was very much pushed up, but after the war, scientists, they were considered like the key people in the world, especially military scientists. Well, I don't think I've ever asked you this. I haven't asked you most of the things I'm asking, but you're Jewish. Hitler killed a lot of Jews. How did you feel about the Holocaust? I don't think we've actually really talked about is it just an intellectual tragedy to you or did I ever feel. I know a bit. What do you think about human nature after that? Who you see that I have parents and my parents. They have parents, which my grandparents and they're my great grandparents. So all of those all of those, without exception, were killed in Holocaust. Zero died with their own death nature of this, all of them, they were killed because they were already a little bit older, like I am now, and they were sure that Germans, they will not touch them. Come on. Just something to old people. It's kind of strange. And all of them, without exception, all of that, they were killed. So it is, you know, like initially in my life, I just it was like a Clearlake hatred with respect to Germans in general, which only later I mean, it was clear that it's not a Nazi, it's not German in Germany, but that's that it was very serious feelings about that. So hatred. But so as you as you grew up, did it, um, are you hopeful about. Whether people are good or evil and did that have an impact on, you know, the fact that you can see so much evil, you can become cynical the way you still did you? Is there still an optimistic, positive person inside you? Yeah, there is. I am optimistic myself. I am optimistic. So just the. The point is that like a. I was when I just started growing up, even even in high school. Level of anti-Semitism was like a way lower, and in general, I felt myself always way more Soviet. Then I was a Russian, Ukrainian or Jewish or so. What was your relationship with the Soviet Union? We'll talk about coming to America, but what was your feeling? So you proud for it for many years? I was very proud. I was very proud of the style of life where science is really popular, where people there working not for money, but people that are working for me to make something interesting, to make something good. It is a place where if you if you if you're good, you are rewarded. And that was a healing. It was propaganda, obviously. So for me, when I was in elementary school, middle school, high school, and I would say in school, I was feeling that I'm extremely proud of something that. It was this shock change and then a lot of friends, they start going to Israel or America, so just everything start changing everything. Thirty years after Stalin, after all, it's so nice. It's, uh, it's already. I'm talking about late 1970s in the 70s and the 1970s already. Like people, they again start feeling that they are Jewish because of significant immigration to the American, to Israel. OK, see, you were in Kiev through high school. Mm hmm. So let's look to your next chapter, your life. And can you tell me. What is Fischbeck as it's I don't even know what the full English name is, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and what is it in Russian? The full name Moskovsky Nikiski Institute. And they, um, it's it's not a committee, but it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mhm. Yeah, yeah it is. Am I p g yes. I mean it's kind of, it's a kind of a kind of um it's maybe a little more like a Caltech. Oh no. Was there an engineering component. So it's very small. Right. I mean it was, it was the size of a Caltech. Yes. And it was very much. Focused on. Science and military science and now sorry to interrupt, and this was in Moscow. Yeah, and so you came from Kiev to Moscow. Moscow. So how did you get into. So, yeah. So you said because this is focused on science, military science. This is like the I saw on the Internet this description of the maybe you can talk to it math and physics, education at MIT, the number of hours I think, or compared to this year. And they were I mean, they were making, first of all, the physical education shorter and covers like an order of magnitude more material. Yes, exactly. What can you explain what the what their experience is like, what the what their idea of the kind of how the they're putting you through is what the philosophy. But that is what we have been looking for because, you know, don't forget that. Well, you're coming to the place and you feel yourself best in the world. And when you meet people from, you know, outside, you're like a you're like a different personality. You're from MIT, you are from Rochester. So it was a lot of songs. A lot of it was a very and we were so much proud that number of credit hours. It was incredible. We work from nine to five each day. You can from nine to five. It is eight hours. Thirty eight hours of classes. How many days a week, six days a week, so you can count and it's and the level was and your requirements are very, very, very, very strong. And as math, physics, chemistry, what was the range of subjects? In important ways, importantly, like when you enter like a you start with very high level mathematics, physics and chemistry, actually. And so why did you want to go? So basically because you felt that you were one of the best people in the world at math and physics. So this is the place to go and chemistry and chemistry. And that's that's that's the way to go. By the way, when I came to Moscow, I hesitated for about one day because I also I was in love with mathematics and mathematics meant like a freedom. So they had less classes. They were more open for, like, creative thinking. Well, it was like, oh, what's the best word to say what they do? Like in sports, like when you make like a something extremely hard for you, like a what's the name, how you say, uh, for military. For military. For military. When I was a boot camp. Yeah. When I said boot camp but I said, yeah, this is really intense. So it is a sense of weeding out the weak. Yes. And that was going on actually. So the significant number of students, they were actually leaving after the first semester. Yeah, it was extremely challenging. Also, keep in mind that it was about OK, usually group, it was like a 25 people 30 and usually one girl. So it was like a whatever the three percent growth, 97 boys. It's also create a very special atmosphere. Well, uh, maybe just the day before we get into the special atmosphere, what was your journey to Fisher like? So I think I read a book, A Love of Math, by Ed Frankel, also Russian. I think you mentioned this stuff in there. And he's also Jewish. And he said that there was a lot of anti-Semitism that that that there is a bunch of schools that you weren't I mean, it was either explicitly or implicitly, no Jews allowed. Yeah, well, so did you. So what was the process of getting into this place and how much anti-Semitism was there in that picture at that period? It was 1970. It wasn't clear. Well, it's anti-Semitism. Yes, absolutely. But what I mean that it was like for Jews, it was very difficult to get into the universities. Very simple. But in. Most of universities, the rule was kind of hidden, so just it was like a Jewish boy and not Jewish boy and they were going to the same exam and the professor gives like a D or C for a Jewish guy and like B or A for for a Jewish guy. If their level is the same, it was just in most of places, but most going into physics and technology, it was very different exams. They were absolutely honest. However, however they count. It was two exams in physics and two exams in mathematics or mathematics. Great mathematics or physics reason, physics, ABCDE and A is five BS four, C three, D two. And if you're Jewish, an exam, they were very, very, very, very, very, very tough. Yeah, the all I hear all of them and both written and oral, they were extremely challenging. But equally for that matter, you are Jewish or Jewish were you know, if you are Jewish, you have to have to to go through that. You have to have either 19 or 20, which means. Yeah. Which means it should be eight or one. Well, if you're not Jewish, 17 is absolutely OK, 16, some people, 15, some people. So it was made clear and beside that, it's completely fair. Yeah, it was, you know, it was from some point of view, it was good because it is not like a cheating. It was like a clear rule. Let's do it. It was very interesting that after exams, it was a special interview and it was interview with. Always a really high level scientists. It was like two or three famous famous famous scientists and the one or two KGB people and the and they just, you know, manage this operation. And it is impossible to discuss, you know, they say, yes, you are accepted, great. They say, no, you're not. Why Leithauser? So what was your favorite subject, topic ideas that you fell in love with in, uh, in the first few years of this year? It was general physics because we had absolutely beautiful. A lecture and a half his books, even now I have over there, he wrote like a lot of books on a civilian civilian. Yeah. And he was a very interesting personality. I was in love with him for, I would say, two years, not more than that, because, um, his idea was you have to present physics. Absolutely. Without calculus. So it should be no derivatives and no integration. How is that possible? I'm just do you do physics? You can say physics. You mean like mechanics, so. No, no, no, no, no, no. Physics means physics with mechanics. It's a thermal sciences. It's electricity, optics and nuclear physics. Without Kappos, without. OK, the only thing he did not touch, it was not quantum mechanics was quantum mechanics in the air back then. Yeah. Yes. But not for this gentlemen. Not for this professor. He was not so much he was not a famous scientist. He was a famous teacher. And then only then I just, you know, jump to the world of theoretical physics and and chemistry. So and that the next step in my life is just jumping into theoretical physics. And what would branch of theoretical physics. Were you interested in so I've never actually heard you talk much about the world of the big, like general relativity. So looking out into the stars you were more interested in like what? Physics phenomena? Were you interested in it now or that? That so at that time. At that time, after these two years with you, can I just changed completely to absolutely opposite approach to purely theoretical physics. And at that time, the most popular it was the so-called Lundahl minimum. Mm hmm. So then down to ten bucks and they are. Believe me, they are. Wow, so they are so hard. Yeah, they are. Just for somebody of those just, you know, hardest of the hardest, like, very challenging, very difficult. And it's boys. So just they say if you want to show yourself, you have to go. The so-called Landow mean we have to go through 10 exams. Actually, because the first one is, was mathematics, and then there are physics, still physics 10 and you know, it was a challenge. It was very difficult. I went through that just actually, you know, just to prove. Yeah. That I can do that. To be honest, I did not. And and at least I hate that because it was not so much. It is not Feynman. You know, it is just something up to that. The opposite. Yeah. But it's it's painful almost for the sake of being painful. Yes. It's like it's like you are doing the martial arts. Yeah. That's just. To show yourself that you can do that, yeah, so that's what I did, and then when I was actually I was doing that, but in the middle, it was the first time I came to each other instead of atomic energy. So speaking of which, what is the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy and who was your so I feel like an artistic adviser. So who was your adviser? Who were the mentors in this period of your life? Are Muslims the physics and technology? It's very interesting approach. It's so-called physics system. Yeah. What does it mean to me the first three years you work in classes. And then you go to actual national labs and you choose them, they choose you, etc, etc., and three years you work there and you listen to the classes. But these classes are not from teachers, not from teaching professors, but from very, very high level actual scientists. So and who was so who was the person who was the person that you connected with? Who was your adviser in that fourth year, fifth year. Yeah. Well, and what's Kurchatov. So that's one of that's that's the connection. Yeah. Yeah. Kurchatov, it's there's downtown Moscow, right. Yeah. Yeah. Kurchatov, it's a guy it's like a father of Russian atomic bomb. And he built a big reactor in central Moscow. The interest in that it was in nineteen in nineteen ninety, nineteen forty six. I think, you know, they built the first reactor and then the bomb in 1949. So and it was a it's it's you know, like in America there is a group of national labs different, like a Oakridge National Lab at Los Alamos National Lab, Argonne National Lab, etc. in Russia. I would say most of this lab, they were combined together in this one, Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy. So it's like you can imagine, like a combination of most of American national labs. In one place, it was 15000 people working there, 15. So that's a huge it's like a city inside of city. And when they were created, they were focused on nuclear physics and nuclear engineering and everything around. Development to build atomic bomb and the same thing for. Fusion bombs, all for hydrogen bombs, and but later they add the Saudis face physics groups, etc. So, yes, it was a I would say it's still now the most, I would say the strongest research center in the old Soviet Union. So I decided to go there and I decided to go to plasma. So in January 1972, I came to they did not let me inside of it. I came over to the gate and I met my first professor who brought me. There was Professor Linyi through the Koff. He's now professor emeritus of University of Maryland. I saw him a couple of years ago last night, and he brought me to his house and he spoke and just he said, I just remember forever. He he told me, you want it's like the story was in the pool and he said, You want a tea with milk or with honey or. And my answer was exactly the same as Winnie the Pooh. I did. We the boy that time, I said, OK, all of the above, please. Because why? Because we were hungry. Very simple. And he spoke to me and he started working. It was and I made my first. Actually, paper, you wrote your first paper and that's who you were, and that was on plasma, it wasn't plasma. And but then in the half of a year, he told me that he likes what we are doing, but he will be unable to help me in the life because I'm Jewish and to four Jewish Jewish person even look absolutely brilliant. To get inside of Kurchatov, you have to have a stronger helper's. And he recommend me to meet Regiment Rossana and really at that moment. So it was a moment when I start to names I know well because Rosoff as is legendary. So because of you, I seem to have met a lot of people from Fischbeck. Yeah. And much like Amitay, they're never shy about telling you that they're from Visger because a lot of pride. So I know Rossana for maybe you can tell about them. The other guy, um I guess the like us of winning a lot of people these days know from the shadow of Chernobyl who is but he obviously has deep roots and Kurchatov and is a very also interesting person. So OK, so Rossana, who's this legendary human that I've heard so much about. Well, with, uh, you know, that plasma fusion plasma, it is not only like making the stock market, but it is diagnostic that your measurement, characterizations or the most challenging is how to measure it. So Ruthanna was world accepted as a father of plasma diagnostics. So he was a very, very, very nice. A person working with plasma diagnostics, both theory and experiments, and at that time in 1973, approximately, oh, he decided he was asked by have to start plasma chemistry, not plasma physics, but plasma chemistry, because they wanted to disassociate uranium hexafluoride and plutonium hexafluoride and they were unable to do it without liking traditional ways. And they decided to try plasma. So. And have agreed. To take a lead in plasma chemistry and at that point, you see that I was in a good but good moment, in a good place. So I was lucky, actually, because all of them, they were physicists, especially Rosana, deeply, deeply, deeply physicist. And he needs help from a good young person who is not afraid of chemistry, being a physicist. So he looked around and told him that there is a young guy, a very interesting personality. He's good in physics, but he's in love chemistry also. So try him. And to me, he said, go through Asanov. He's a tough guy, but but he will be able to help you because to help you to stay to go further in your life. Because he's a close friend of working together with Lagos in Lagos. I was associate director, vice president of Kurchatov Institute. So that's how it all started. And they asked me a couple of things. Can you do this? Can you do that in chemistry? So it is just physicists and talking chemistry. So let me stop put because I'd like to step back in a little bit to talk about what is plasma. Even so, before all that, let's talk about. So what? The step away from science, what impact did he have on you as a human being? What memories do you have of him that you love or hate or both? You know, I would say the best word would be both, because do you remember, Rosana? Not hard to know what I remember because I was totally story personality. He's a personality. He's he's extremely tough, very quiet. He's mostly not talking. He's only looking at you always in your eyes. He's like, well, that's he's brilliant. Smart. He was absolutely smart. Absolutely brilliant. So you are very tough and tough. And so you have to be basically that makes for a great adviser because this is a person to be afraid of. Yeah. And you have to you're basically for the rest of your life or trying to prove yourself to him. Yes, that's exactly the case with the admission that you met Rosanna. Yeah, that's the personality. Is there a memory, a story that stands out to you maybe that represents him? Well, it was I was going to science, right. But I remember one story just forever. One of the I was already not a postdoc, well graded student. So it was a one and the greatest student you remember from third grade and muskies physical. And she was supposed to start, you know, after vacation she came. But but something happened and she came about one week later. So, I mean, it's her adviser, which is another famous scientist and I was in the office of Rossana, so he brought this girl. Mm hmm. And it's a nice girl. I know so many girls in and we stick. Not so many girls. So she came to this office. And Ruthanne, if you just look at her. Like a snake, you know, like look at her without any words. For about maybe the 20, 30 seconds, just look at her eyes. And then she said he said. Your colleagues, they started working a week ago. Your what your colleagues, while other students are the students, they are already working, start working one week ago. That's what he said. And kept looking at her, just staring and staring right. And she, you know, is a stark warning from her face. Yeah. And it was like a torture. It's he did a seizure by silence and staring. Yes. Yeah, that's a good sign. Maybe like three, three minutes. But even for me, it was like maybe one hour for her, maybe it's like whole life. OK, let's go to the most important question. How did you meet Mom? Oh, so this is before Kurchatov, I suppose, all around that time. It's no, it is already. I met Mom in nineteen seventy three, which is second, third, fourth year of yours and that was my. Third year, no, it was my fourth year already, and for mine, it was the second time she was there. Yeah, I told you that it's like three percent. So she was one of the girls in one of the special things in this special. And. Yeah, and she survived this kind of also super training by the first year. She survived everything. Yeah. I mean, so how did how did you uh. OK, so there you are, part of the ninety seven percent. Yeah. Uh, with a giant ego as we can already tell. Uh, by the way, did your ego serve you well, we'll talk about a little more actually. Yes, I think, yes. What about in science. Yes, I think people will hear that you have a bit of an ego, but I think it's deserved. So you're it's the same with fine and it's the same with Leonard Susskind. A lot of physicists have this weird dance with ego. It's a useful weapon when you go the cautiously. But did it help you in terms of with mom? I would not say so of confidence. Oh, well, how did you. The most difficult. Yeah. Is, you know, to to go to this because it's a boys and girls, they live separately and different like this place. Those are alligators and. Or like what. Yeah, I mean they have to you have to be clever and how to get to this like a place. I mean there are. So what happened that on their floor something disappear. They don't know some money or whatever or some books or something. And, and a friend of mine, he was, you know, like I would say the we used to say so he was like a student responsible for like everything should be nice. So I said that I will help you. Let's go to these girls and let's try to to help them. So we come to them, start helping and spend then the whole night reading. Just reading poetry, I think we see that reading poetry with tea, it was you and who else and me mom are and to my friends, and it was also to other girls which live in the same room. So do you remember what poems you're reading? Is there something, if you can imagine, if you are talking about eight hours or whatever, seven hours. So it was a lot of poetry, but is there is there something from that period that stands out to you? Maybe. As poetry that you were reading, not something you've written for mom yet, but do you remember from that night? I mean, it's an important night, right? Yeah. Uh, you remember what kind of tea? The cheap one. Because this song is that we used to know. I think so. It was. No, no. So OK. And it's like it was offensive for girls. We had a huge respect to them, you know, and then gentlemen don't drink vodka environments. So at least in the beginning. So when did you. First, fall in love with mom. You know, and you have like you said, it's 97 percent, so it's immediately one, two, three. Yes. OK. Well, that does so. But she she was beautiful and she's beautiful. And it was December 14th. And still even now, we celebrate this date, December 14th when you met. Yeah, well, that's this Poythress stuff. But it was the same day, week, December 14th, two days ago. So we celebrated 46 years. What is the oldest instrument of this day was tea and poetry. But, um, I get that also guitar. I think, yes, it's a guitar. And when you say guitar, I mean, there's a bard. Tradition is basically poetry to music. Any kind of lyrics is really important. Yeah, I would say it was 96 percent. I mean, it was mostly lyrics and guitar. It was just like, how did you win her over? Oh, that's that's how what's your secret? Well, how do you do it? Actually also became her mentor. OK, which made my life a little bit easier and, you know, I started with poetry and I ended up with science and then actually. And we stay together, we married them three years after that. Do you remember any poems you wrote in her? Well, not no, not of course, if I were to say I would for three years, but at that moment I would say like reciting all these life poems is probably not the best stuff to do now. It should be a special discussion about that, probably together with her. Look what I can say, that I have a couple of this book about booklets of poetry, but it is already not the same. I was already not the same as they was in in high school, which means that the time already most of my poetry was mean. I would say not funny, but more like the witty playful. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. OK. When did you know you will marry her? When did you know that sort of this is this is going to be this is the one you remember this month? The three, yeah. Maybe not during the first five minutes, but maybe after 20 minutes. Yeah, I'm going to marry that one. Yeah, it is very I mean, she she she she is beautiful. And she was even up. She was younger. Me too. So just almost immediately. But it was clear that we cannot do it, you know, immediately. So we are waiting until I graduate from from from from undergrad, not on the grill from master level because, you know, in Soviet Union it was undecorated plus master. It was like higher education. And after that it was. Pardillo suggests we wait until I'm done with M.. When did you first learn that you will be a father? So for people who don't know I have an older brother, uglier, fatter, stupider brother named Greg. Oh, he's good. I'm just ugly. No, he's just 1977. It's like he was born in 1978. Oh, so. It was not an easy moment for me, I would say even a very difficult moment, because. It was a concept in Soviet Union which is difficult to understand here in the so-called preppie saga is just even not possible to translate, which means that you have to have a special, absolutely complicated permission, enormously complicated mission to leave in Moscow and Leningrad, which is in St. Petersburg now. So to do that, you have to either have to be born there. And that's it, actually, so it was a closed series, so and I was from Kiev and she was and she's from the Middle East. So just how to do that? In 1976 and 1977, I was like in the first grade of first year of. And without this permission to live in Moscow. So just it was a difficult moment. This is a practical thing because you want to you want to stay in Moscow longer term because. Yeah, because in Soviet Union, Moscow, it was like a number one place, but not so easy to get this permission. It's extremely complicated. And because mom is originally from a different area of the Soviet Union. Yeah. And there's communist complications, bureaucracy, all that kind of stuff. She was born she lived in the area for first uranium, the most important uranium mines in Soviet Union. So that's. She's from virosome, so that's where you were he was. Yeah, yeah, a little bit nuclear. That explains so much. So how did it feel like when when Greg was born? I mean, just becoming a father. What was that story like? Yes, it's a pain. I was very much. Well, obviously, I was very happy, but I was nervous about future because future was not clear at the time. Not clear at all about this time. My situation was actually very sophisticated. Well, it's a little bit long story, but what happened that I get sick and and they didn't know where to put me. It was infectious and and finally lined up in the house of Saraf, which is interesting moment, and was mixed altogether with grec births, with me being sick with with ISSACHAROFF altogether, whatever it was like with the mess, it's just a stressful mess. And when I came to get close to the city and middle Asian and here now they call it Hodgett. Oh, so it is neurogenic. Well, I was very happy. And one of the first out at that point, I wrote my first not book but chapter in the book, and it was the topic that's my chemistry and chemistry and topic of my chapter. It was a synthesis of nitrogen oxide from air. And there is a very famous I love it, a picture of Greg on the wall when he just, you know, I think maybe a couple of weeks and he's reading the book and he's in front of and he's just like so much interesting. He's reading this plasma chemistry book. Yeah, it's a good picture. It's a good picture. Right. So how did it feel like so obviously, Greg is a disappointment. So how did it feel like when I was finally born? Oh, with you it was it was way, way easier. And we were way more happier because it was 1983. So which means that we were already in Moscow. We got this Potiskum, we got this permission and we got our apartment. So just everything was so nice and so beautiful and and, you know, Cherry, on top of this cake, it was you and the and the only funny story, which is like always mom, she used to say, is like a for some reason, I don't know even why, but everybody was sure that you are a girl and not you. But like that is the girl. The girl. Yeah. And everything was prepared for her, for a girl. And and we were staying and near this clinic and the me and Greg and just and it was now that it is a boy. And Greg, you mentioned this famous phrase that he's so much happy that you are a boy. And you know the story also that he was five years old and he was for some reason, sure. That to that man. They make boys and the women, they make girls. And he was so much surprised when he said that, ma'am, she's so good, is impressed. Yes. That she could make a boy a boy. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So were you ready to be a father? Would you say it? You know, being a father, it's a big commitment. Big, big, big commitment, because it's an it's a real family. When Greg was born, it was like it was a mess. It was very challenging. It was very difficult when you were like fun and nice and everybody was so happy. And even if you look at pictures, you know, like a picture with you, they're just yes, it's a smiling, it's a happy and bring joy to the world health. And basically, that's the way you were when you were like, you're always, you know, you wake up and you smile. That's good. It's a good sign. Very good. Well, let's go, let's go. So I wanted to be a psychiatrist. Let me psychoanalyze you. Do you think you were a good dad? Who? Well, to be honest, it's not for me to judge what I what I can tell you that my whole life I just tried. Sometimes more successful, sometimes less successful. To be good, that that it's not for me to judge. I mean, you know, I can give you an example, like when Greg was very young for me, like a. Very important was Lundahl. Books and I had this 10 books on the shelf made the way they are, no, they're not here. They're in my office and you know, that's the books which I read and just I put my. Yeah, sweat, blood and sweat and blood and tears right into this book. And what Greg did. He just took these books and he looked like this for the master. What is that like? Oh, markers, marker markers. And he puts everything around this, like the cover of this. He drew on it, you know, he just it's like graffiti. It's not like it's all over this. And it was how to say, you know. For me, it was not secret. It is sacred, I mean, yeah, and I was just I remember at this moment it was so much not happy, just, you know, and I just try to explain and I mean, and I didn't even. And Greg, he keeps saying even now that the he wasnt he he was sure that he is doing something good, that he's just, you know, that I love these books. So he tried to make them even, you know, prettier, prettier. Yeah, that's so what I'm trying to say that. Welcome to being a dad right there. Yes, yes. Yes. So if you can go back and do something different in terms of being a dad, what would you. Is there something you regret? Well, you know, I would say. Her. People are different. Some people, they always say they want a different life and they sure for some reason that if they start again, it would be better. It is not my case for some reason. I don't know. Maybe it is just like internal strength, just like you mentioned about Feynman, but I just always try to protect myself and family and just I was sure, like my father during the war, that if I am strong. Everything will be good, but. And as a result, believe me or not. And it's psychologically it helped me psychologically significant. I really believe. That I am always right. Which is which is strange, maybe, yeah, but it is a way to protect myself, I don't know, and protect the family. So when you ask me what you would be differently, nothing. My feeling always is that my son is the best one. I always try to give advice, sometimes more than necessary. And probably it's I'm doing that wrong. But what I can do differently, I'm I'm sure that I'm right. It's a kind of defense mechanism. So you don't you are family have done a lot to make a better life for for us, for me. And I think I've seen you work very hard to take steps through life to do make a better life for all of us. We took risk many times and there is a feeling that looks like everything is OK, OK. OK, so while creating. Sort of creating taking risks. Creating opportunities for our family, for me, for my brother, there is to me always I felt a distance. So what if I told you you felt distant to me as a father and then I never really felt close to you. To this day, do you think that's true? I don't know what and what I can say that I tried as much as possible. To be as good father as they can, or it's sometimes it's difficult to. Combined the system with this self-protection, like you said, yes. So that's, you know, so there's an interesting it could be a Russian immigrant thing. It could be a Jewish thing, too, but sort of say if you're captain of a boat or something and you see if somebody pressures your family on the boat, it seems that you were more focused on just making sure the boat doesn't crash or like sort of focusing on or maybe getting a bigger boat or for the family, like there's this focus of the journey in providing stability and so on, then not actually and not sitting down and enjoying time on the boat that you've built. You know, I have with the family. I agree with you, but it is not Russian. It is not Russian, it's a Jewish and it's immigrants. Because so many times I was very nervous that one thing goes wrong and everything crashes and there is a million things in our life. But I am. Always feeling at this point is the most dangerous, dangerous here, that is OK, that is OK. That's that's a dangerous. So I feel this danger and I'm. Overdoing this nervousness, and it is always with me, and that's why even now, at any point, I. Too much nervous because I see it looks like my feeling is that like people, they do not see that this is a deadly point, like a crucial bottleneck or whatever. Yeah. And and and I know that if I say that directly people, it can be not good. So I have to play with that in one way or another. And so but I would say that it's a typical for Jewish people because they went through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, even thousands of years of problems. And also for immigrants, because that's immigrant life here. Remember, your own story was high school when you first came there. I mean, and there is some kind of tiny details which can make your life miserable. Yeah, middle school. I mean, that was a particularly interesting moment that I think it's an interesting moment that I don't know how to explore correctly because we came to this country. So I was maybe 13. I don't remember those middle school. And it was a very different culture change. It was a very, very, very different culture. And we went to a bar. It was a it's a middle school stuff for people in general. But I went from having a lot of friends from culture that I loved somehow deeply sort of this math and science that you talked about this. I mean, there's so many French dug deep friendships to a very shallow place and sort of the difference between what, you know, everybody I don't discount the suffering of people, but I would say suffered. You know, you want to be like, that's stupid. But I really psychologically suffering. And at the same time, you were sort of totally unable to understand that, obviously, because a second I think you came to America, the step to come to America is a beautiful step of opportunity. So there's this dichotomy of like to me, that was a horrible thing for my own selfish, personal little experience. I didn't see that. I didn't know at that age you don't think about the big picture things. But it's an interesting difference. To stop to America is a really interesting step because you're sacrificing so much of who you are. It's a big, big leap. Big leap. But it's it's the it's the good leap for the future of the family, for opportunity for for building a life together. And it's interesting. How did you think about that process? We'll talk about it a little bit. We'll take a step back and talk about it more as our bigger family. But as a as a dad, as a family, not big. But let's just day to day. How did you that move? How did you experience it? How did you think about it? Well, this is a moment when I can. Read for you a poetry. Unfortunately, again, it's in Russian, but I will use. No, no, it's OK. I it's only a couple of sentences I'll give you from there. And it's a beautiful, very nice, basically Jewish poet in 1941, beginning of the war. So he said then Asmir seduced by youth. I predict emotional pluck it with some truth in it. Yes, but you just as a danetta. Well, it's a wonderful poem, I can read the whole poem later, not with the microphone, but listen to that. You are very nervous before, but when it is already back, when you are already in action, you don't think about that. So this moment of coming to America, the first period. I was not nervous, I was like I a machine I was doing. I was doing that. So, yeah, I mean, it's the same when you decide the decision is the right one. So you see the three I can just you know, he is the translator. They go when you are going to attack, you are thinking. Yeah, when you cry before that, you know, the stress, the anxiety, the the tears, but when you're ready there, yeah. You believe in your star and you go and you don't think much. Well, let me pass on this. Since I asked you if you think you were a good father. What? What you know, was I a good son? Yes. The better one than Greg, obviously. So, uh, but, uh, what would you know, without any hesitation, I can say that you were and you are very good, son, because you understand when you're talking. And it was from the beginning, he always. Even if you're not kids, usually they think about themselves. And I see the whole world is rotating around them, but you are way less clear just how many years you just you saw people around you were able to to to see, OK, this is this is mother and father. I mean, you just see people. And that's incredible. Also just. From the first months of your life, he was a loving. Smiling. Yeah, and believe me, it is not so many kids are doing that, which means that somewhere deeply in your I don't know where it's genes probably. You're smiling. So, you know, like when you when I see a good person or not a good person. Take a look at the person when this person wakes up. Then people, they wake up. And they immediately smell it, and that's something I don't know, it's like a miracle, so you're OK. So thank you for being a good son. Yeah, maybe I'm not a good father. It's another theory. But what this context makes it much more important for me to criticize you. It makes it impossible for you to criticize me, which is exactly how I set it up. OK, but, um, so you mentioned Legat, of as one of the people in your story had Kurchatov Institute. Can you tell the story and your involvement in Chernobyl? Sort of. That played a part in our lives as well. So what's the story there? What is Chernobyl for people who don't know? Yeah, Chernobyl. It's a it's a small city town with a huge nuclear power plant. And it's a place of world, our biggest nuclear severe accident. The reason of this accident. The best, if you know, fix, but the other people, they can watch the movie, which is the HBO show on HBO show, very good. Actually, I did not expect that it is really very good or the major reason is they just went through special tests and just testing regimes and they start to decrease activity of actor very fast and reactors start dying and they just increase activity. And then they were unable to stop it. And the temperature go very high. Metal clothing start reacting with cooling water, producing hydrogen. Hydrogen reacts with oxygen. And it was a huge hydrogen explosion, the so-called DDT. And because of this explosion, actually a very, very, very, very heavy. A tip of the reactor jump up and down and 40 tons or something like that, I thought was huge just then destroy the whole reactor and all this nuclear fuel, start falling down, create some critical mass. And it was a nuclear explosion, but not contained. So, yes, it was. What part of the story did the show get right? And what part of story does he get wrong, in your view? The cost of just things you've experienced personally? I just very shortly describe what happened. Yes. That like it was this kind of already nuclear expansion and everything from inside was boom. I went out and actually was a wind maker, almost a half circle around the world. So that's an accident. Yes. Oh, for instance, atomic energy, it was a very big deal because the whole community, the whole country, actually, they consider that this huge institute is responsible for this accident. So their action don't forget, it's a communist country. They decided it's like like an army that all people, all scientists, they aren't responsible, doesn't matter whatever. If you're doing plasma or you're doing nuclear reactor does matter. You have to go and help them. You want it. You don't want it. You like it. You don't like it. In the movie it was shown, I would say movie is about 97 percent. Absolutely. Right? Absolutely correct. It's unbelievable how good they made it, they made this movie from the people, the culture, the science, everything they did in the bureaucracy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They did not overdo that because it's very easy to go is a communist country, that's why. Yeah. And vice versa. So they did it. Very good harmony. Very good balance. Yeah, that was perfect. What did they get wrong here? At least my impression is that they show the apartment of Lagos, of Lagos was actually almost a copy of Freeleagus visually to just. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. There's this actor. He looks like Lagos and just, you know, wow, we just like as a good actor, actually, it's a good actor. British. Yes. You know, and that's but it was shown that's like a little bit of American propaganda. They show this Lagos of living in like a small apartment, uh, like a smoking cigarettes, right? No, come on. It was. Can you imagine, like a vice president advocating a vice prime minister? He lived in an apartment complex in the Soviet Union or that position means you get you get handed the juvenile department here, Helidon, not an apartment. It was like a special house belonging to him in a lake next door to the institute. This house did not belong to him. Yeah, but that's what he. So just he lived like in a in a castle and like and in a movie, it was a little bit not like. What's your memory of him? Have you ever met him. Come on. He's my my my supervisor. So like OK, so it's like a heavy heavy it's like a like motion for you. Yeah. Like I had like a sauna and the like for you. He was a diver and like the guy. So for me it's like a. So did you have a chance to see Machaca. Yeah, it's here. I think it's like yeah. The other day. Every day. Um. My feeling is. He was very good in nuclear chemistry. He was the he was a member and a very significant member of Communist Party. The difference with Rossana for was not very much liking Communist Party while he was so, he was a secretary of Communist Party organizational culture and he stood for a couple of years. So this kind of personality. So he was a great scientist, very interesting, very bright. But at the same time, he was a communist and he kind of belief in these communist ideas. And he took all that responsibility very close to his heart. And that's exactly like it is shown in the movie, especially when. The director of the Chernobyl station made it incredibly strange mistake because the reactor was already destroyed. You remember my explanation, but what they see, the temperature is going up. And his decision was, you know, you're an artificial intelligence, not so much in physics and chemistry, but if temperature is going up, what people do, if they're not professionals, let's put water there. And he made a decision to put enormous amount of water into the reactor to cool it down, but people, they come on, I guess we have seen a couple of seconds ago, there is no reactor. There is nothing to cool down because it's now can you imagine this huge temperature and you put water into this huge temperature and metals. Metals immediately react with water producing hydrogen. So actually, what they did, it's. It's it's extremely bad and it's nicely shown in the movie, and he made a decision for three people to go inside. Mm hmm, under the reactor and open their wealth to let this hot water, to let this water out and these people, they did it, obviously it was clear that they were going to die. Do you think the accident could have been avoided? The Chernobyl accident. You know, so deeply interlinked to Soviet culture, I see no way, no. You know how to say, is it possible to be sure that it will be no fire in the city? It is a very low probability. It's a sexual coincidence. It's a couple of stuff was extremely low probability happened at the same time, but it was really important stuff. Chernobyl happened, first of all, because it was no automatic system of control. It was impossible if, let's say already accident, there is no automatic system to stop it. Why, because there's huge rechter, very heavy, very, very, very heavy and big way bigger than erectors, which we have here in the United States. So it's more difficult to control. So I would say it was clear. For many people, that sooner or later. It will be this accident and actually it is a copy of accident, which happened in America in Three Mile Island. It's very similar, but American accident was more better controlled, so it was not so huge. It's still a severe accident. Well, legacies, he took this stuff very close to his heart. And and it is very nicely shown in the movie, and actually that's why his society, he took his own life here. Yeah. And by the way, he's right twice first time not successful. And the second one. So there's a there's a journey of suffering there afterwards. He he he took you know, he wore the burden of credit for that, the responsibility. And yes. Because actually he was claiming that these reactors are the safest in the world. Yeah. And they are but they are way more resistant to small accidents. Right. But. They have this tiny chance of severe accident even now, a lot of these reactors are still the same, are still the same and still around. OK, let's get into the fun. Can you tell me what is plasma? The simple explanation would be like the plasma. It is what we have in fluorescent lamps. If you look around in your room, it is something you have in all kind of sources, like most of Monitor's TV screens, et cetera, a significant number of them, it's most pleasant, localized, ionized gas. What does it mean? Like we have gas around us and let's say with electric field, electrons are separated from ions. So, yes, you take electrons out of molecule. So a molecule becomes positive ion and electron separate with an iron eye. And it's if you take if you take an atom or molecule and take one electron out, what stay there. So iron, it is like a atom or a molecule after the sabari when they lost an electron. And what's interesting about an iron. OK, wait a second. Probably when you apply electric field, whoever is lighter take energy immediately energized very fast. So ions they stay regular. Usually they stay called. Because they're heavy, they're not very much moving, so they're stay cool while they are energized almost immediately. Yeah, and they are temperature in most of plasmas. Whatever you do, electron temperature is usually on ballpark. It's about ten, fifteen thousand Kelvin or Celsius, which means twenty thirty thousand Fahrenheit. But so electronics are very, very, very, very, very hot, and Ion's like gas, they're usually in most cases, they're called. So if I take like a cell phone and touch the screen. Well, inside, you have very often have electrons with a temperature 20, 30000 Fahrenheit, but you cannot feel it. Why? Because it's a one electron per. Millions of molecules, so it's not so many of them. It's like a, let's say, city of Philadelphia do have billionaires in the city of Philadelphia. Maybe one or two, but it's but it's not so much easier to meet them on the street because it's only one or two for a huge city. So the same story here. So it is very energized electrons and usually relatively cold gas. But these electrons, they can do a lot like these billionaires in Philadelphia have have like a couple of these billionaires. They can do a lot. It's only two of them. But actually they can influence life in the city more than everything else because they have ability with the same story. They're so electrons, depending on gas, they're able to create very active species so they can be used as a source of light like fluorescent lamps. They can be used to three different materials. So most of synthetic, though, I would say 100 percent of synthetic materials, they are treated before coloring. Mm hmm. Because, like, you have a nice black tie, but how to make tie black if it is synthetic? If it is natural, it's here, but if it is synthetic material and if you try, you know, paint synthetic material, you know, paint doesn't stick to it. So you plasma treated these electrodes activate the surface and color. They start sticking to the surface. What does it mean to activate a surface? So there's a lot of plasma is interacting somehow with the surface, with this human skin or some kind of surface or what does it mean to treat a surface? Okay, I try instead with modification, but it's you know, if you have polymer like a in the case of your thigh, if I was like a polymer, what what is electron does is just create rage and this way take hydrogen out. Of your time, and this is the opening band and usually oxygens stick to their and become Poola, so you cover the surface with the polar groups, which are always sticky. So that's what is going on. You just take one atom out, you have three bound oxygen there. Polar groups, you stick, you can paint. If if you put the droplet droplet of whiskey on the surface of less, it will stay like a droplet. But if you just plasma treat this glass and then you put droplet droppable groups immediately cover a very significant area. OK, so let's let's step back a little bit. So there is solid liquid gas. He said, yeah, it's ionized gas. Why is plasma sometimes called the fourth state of matter? So what's the difference between gas and ionized gas such that it's a fundamental difference? It is a fundamental difference because like what is going on, that this ionized gas immediately has very different behavior. The word plasma was actually created. Oh, just because of similarity with blood plasma. Mm hmm. So, like you ask the difference between plasma and gas, it is about the same difference, like difference between the water and blood. So species inside of blood, they're very much interacting with each other while the water, they're not much interacting. So why you're being Langmuir? In 1934 36, he started using the word plasma versus ionized gas because he said, take a look, take a look, take a look at this species, interact with each other. I didn't know that. So there is there's a close connections to inspiration from blood plasma. Yes. And it's because of the interactive way more than that. So the guy who just Nobel Prize laureate Aaron Langmuir was a first finalist, basically interaction plasma on the surface. So you can say that he's like a father of modern electronics hardware. So he came up with this word because it take a look. This plasma is kind of funny. It looks like a blood plasma. And people, they start like using this phrase like a joke, then, you know, like everybody, like it's stuck. Oh, that's really interesting. OK, so, uh, you said electron's really hard. So traditionally, plasma is supposed to be very high energy. Very hot. Mm hmm. So he said it's electrons, but there is a hot plasma called plasma so far. OK, in hot plasma. Everything is hot. So if you have more electrons and they are able to heat up the whole gas, it's a hot plasma like solar plasma, the sun or some solar plasma. Some are. And in this case, temperature is very high. Fusion plasma. So just everything is very hot in most of engineering plasma today, including your cell phones, including fluorescent lamps, etc., etc. In this case, only electrons are they're hot and they are unable to heat up everybody. It's like this couple of billionaires in the city of middle class people. Right. And that these electrons there, if it is air, for example, they just they react with oxygen making atomic oxygen, atomic oxygen immediately produce ozone. So atomic oxygen sticks to go to creating ozone. Hazlet ozone means I think in Latin means I smell. So the name of the guy who first saw that it was Seamans, if you remember, company Seamans, so that's the creator of this company because he was the first one to understand this was on and said, wow, it smells. Then they use like a Latin word for that Ozanne and they start using OSN for water cleaning. Right. So what's hot plasma and what's called plasma? She said in the cool plasma, the electrons like the billionaires, is the only thing that stays hot. So what hot plasma? Everybody, billionaires. And so in terms of applications, in terms of the theoretical physics underpinning, what's the difference between hot plasma and cold plasma? There's entire groups of researchers that work on that. Yes, yes, you know, the fundamental difference is when everything is 10000 degrees, what you can do with this material, with this plasma, if everything is 10000, like a 10000 Kelvin, like a 20000 Fahrenheit, what you can do I mean, that stuff melts everything and convert everything into vapor when so scientifically it's way easier because it's like so close to thermodynamic equilibrium. So just very, very, very hot. Substance through applications, applications, the major application is if you want to melt something which require a temperature above, yeah, 2000 Celsius, which is what the is torture's. So if you want if you want to cut Mudo. Metal, you can actually you can cut metal ways, most of metal, they're just you know, they melted on the level of below 2000. So for this metal, with some exceptions, but for this metal fire, you know, combustion torches, they're OK. Now, if you want to melt something which is impossible to melt, like a special hard ceramics. If you cannot mouth it was anything, first of all, why do you need it? Why do you need mail, something which is impossible to mouth if you let's say if you want to protect your airplane. Your airplane, it's a good idea to have an aeroplane with a thin layer of a substance which is impossible to to melt, which is not afraid of anything, I'm not afraid of lightning. I'm not afraid of anything how to do that. You have to melt. We have to cover it with this material. But to cover, we have to melt it now. How to melt something which is impossible to melt. Well, you have to take plasma or plasma goes had plasma. Plasma goes to this huge temperature, then put this powder, you melt it and you spray with thermal plasma. That's the hot kind of that's a high temperature plasma. OK, so what's called plasma then? And what kind of temperatures are we talking about? What's this world in terms of applications and theory that is now fundamentally different from the hot kind are called plasma? It is. It's a situation when you have electrons, all electrons are hot and they generate a lot of active species, radical's atoms, so they can treat different materials. They can make very sophisticated structures. But temperature is low damage. So let's say jumping through official intelligence, if you are talking about computer, how to make. Computer, how to make these wafers, how to make these chips. Yeah, you have to be able to dig tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny ditches. How to do that? You have to have you cannot use mechanical devices, so you have to have something different. Beams, lasers. No, because laser is hitting its temperature. But you cannot take if you just use laser, you if you go to temperature 1000 degrees, you damage your phone. Cannot withstand these temperatures. Yes. The same computer. So that's why there is no alternative today, only called plasma to make. I would say vast majority of electronics devices. So hardware, it's almost, as you say, hardware. It is that. So let me beautifully put what's now you said application. We'll talk about some applications, including plasma medicine, but from a fee, if you put on your theoretical physicists or chemists like fundamental science, what are the interesting problems in plasma mysteries that are not yet understood or things that have been recently understood? I've seen you talk about incredible applications, but let's not cover that. Is there some open problems? How was it understood from a theoretical perspective? I can give you a couple of examples. It's a lot of mysteries. A lot. Why? Because this is strongly non equilibrium media, almost everything else which we have around that. It's an equilibrium. What does that mean? What does it mean for a medium to be in equilibrium? Equilibrium. It means it has temperature. Has temperatures. Yeah, some temperature like this is, let's say, a room temperature. Well, no, I mean, what you mean by that is there's a uniformity to it uniformly. The temperature, not space uniformity, but homogeneity, like it's half temperature. Now, can you imagine something which has a couple of different temperatures at the same point? Is it possible? Yeah, that's what it is. So electrons are very hot, but they are inside of gas and gas is cool like like people, they're swimming in the ocean. So temperature of a person is higher. But here, just temperature is way, way weaker. Now, what started happening in this case? It's a lot of funny miracles, a lot of funny miracles. For example, electoral impact creates excitation of molecules to literally oscillate and people will learn that distribution is becomes very strange. Energy rich molecules, they they take more energy when they have already something and reach people, they become richer. And poor people then becomes more poor. Exactly the same thing they call it capitalism in molecular life happens in plasma. So what is going on? Yeah, you take molecules in plasma. You excite and very fast against all rules of whatever nature, couple of molecules they have to quantum. And they have more and more and more and more and more and more and very soon, like some molecules that have everything. And most of all, could have nothing as a result of this kind of non equilibrium immediately creates losers. So this is one of the reason why lasers, first or first lasers, they were created in plasma. Even now, the most energetic like CO2 laser is a plasma lasers. And there's also plasma lasers. So plasma, very Ethelred application. But physics is here. I can explain it a bit longer, how it works, but it's very similar to what is going on with people. If you already have money, it's easier for you to attract new money if you are actually poor. Sooner or later you will lose your money in the favor of rich people. I'm not sure how well the analogy works, but probably. But they're saying that there's some fascinating, complicated instability about that whole. But it's interesting capitalism. It's increasing instability, instability, not space instability. It's energy instability. Yeah, it's like a yes. You said capitalism and capitalism at the molecular level. It's a it's a capitalism. It's like a wild capitalism. Yeah. Where just everything works against middle class. Who's the Bernie Sanders in this physics analogy? I'm just kidding. That's who's the socialist. OK, I don't take this analogy, but that's interesting that, you know, that plasma works works against Bernie Sanders. So nature. Nature. Yeah, nature is, um, is a more Republican. It's a more of a public nature Republican. Well, not not nature. I mean plasma. It's only non billion plus not equal room plasma equilibrium plasma. It's everything is very much Bernie Sanders is very much on distribution. Yeah. Well non equilibrium plasma is um I live a short life and die quickly, so. Yes. So if you want a long peaceful existence you want to go. That's one of the reasons why Bernie Sanders in physics, that's very interesting that but for this reason, non equilibrium plasma called plasma is able to produce way more miracles as in miracles, meaning very interesting, strange structures, patterns, treatment, like you cannot use hot plasma to make electronic device while you can do it. It's just one example. Another example is like I recently I came yesterday. Well, yeah, yesterday from Japan. So we presented. Ionisation of liquids guesses, so it's a lot of interesting stuff. Oh, liquids, very interesting. Yeah. So you've mentioned physics and chemistry. What is plasma physics and what is plasma chemistry in terms of application, in terms of theory? What are the different lenses of physics and chemistry that you use to explore plasma and how do they differ? You have books on each. Yes, the simplest. I think that it was Feynman who was asked, what is physics? And I think it's him, and after some thinking, he said, well, that's what physicists do. Yeah, so that's a good point. So actually, it's a nice way to say that's a stupid question, but give the questioner more of a chance. So what's the difference between plasma physics, chemistry and even physics and chemistry more broadly? I mean, I don't know what's the more easier distinction to draw? Yeah, oh, I can compare with languages like what's the difference between English language and Chinese language? In one case you have how many? I forgot 23 or whatever characters. How many point. Yeah, twenty five. OK, sounds like there's something twenty and in Japanese. Oh and the Chinese you have 10000, 40000 characters. So changes, it's chemistry. English is physics. Physics has a small number of rules and the laws of nature and operates with that. So understanding, let's say, how to ionized gas. It's physics, understanding how to create plasma in liquid. It's physics, understanding how to make a device, how to make a light source, plasma light source. It's physics now when we are coming to changes. Oh, I'm into this chemistry. It means that there is a million different tables, not rules. Tables. Yes, it's tables instead of rules. So what's that going on? You just look at that and say, oh my gosh, this plasma, especially in plasma, creates thousands of species and we have to understand what kind of species. And sometimes you need these species, but you don't need these species. So how to have more of that and how to have less of these? And there is no rules. Well, there are some rules, but about as much as in creating creating Chinese characters. So a lot of it is a lot of the knowledge in plasma chemistry is discovered through experimentation. Yeah. And I would say chemistry is more art. Uh, physics. It's a little bit more science, like a linguistics, you know, English language. It's possible. It's also a lot of challenges. But it's simple while talking about simple and complicated going from physics and chemistry. Let's go to biology, one of the exciting fields. You're one of the founders of this plasma medicine. Yeah. What is plasma medicine called plasma called plasma creates a lot of species, interesting species, unexpected species. You remember this capitalism and molecular life. You can a little bit change parameters and it can be, wow, look, I start generating this strange substance, et cetera. So plasma is very sensitive. The different it's like a human body and plasma generates very interesting active species, actually, to be honest, almost exactly the same. So Professor David Grace, he keeps saying that he was impressed when he looked in books of medical biology books and he said, like a species, active species inside of human body and in Coplan, that they're the same sort. Plasma creates very interesting stuff. And it was clear for people from the beginning, like already for more than 100 years that. If you put plasma in contact with human body, you can treat some diseases, you can do a lot of stuff. The problem was that if plasma is energetic and you put these energetic plasma in contact with human Baddiel, you kill the person. So actually, the whole point, the whole interesting point of plasma medicines or plasma medicine came from physicists actually where it becomes possible to make. Uniform, not damaging, very energetic plasmas examples. Atmospheric pressure, for example, we have atmospheric pressure around atmosphere and there is a lightning. Lightning is hot and very energetic and very damaging. Plasma sources, plasma charges like lightning. It's impossible to use to treat human body, you'll just destroy a lot of distri. Do you kill the tissue? Yeah. Now, what happened, like 16 years ago? It was a first time. When physicists learned how to make lightning not like a concentrated in a tiny channel to be diffused and just around the big, big, big, big area make to make it something like a aurora borealis from lightning. And it was actually in 1990s, a lot of like efforts. It was a French approach. They just etc.. But finally. We want. Because what we had was like an out-of-the-box solution to make extremely short electric pulse. Short especially or temporarily in time, time, in time, so let's say because we have when we have lightning between clouds and ground, it's like a continuous voltage. But if we apply this voltage between sky and ground. Let's say a couple of nanoseconds, there is no time to create the lightning channel, just simply no time. So what is going on, you start creating something like aurora borealis, so you have a glowing everywhere. Because there is no time to create a channel for this place. And then you stop. Yes, and then you repeat this again and you stop and repeat this path again. So through this nanosecond passing through time possible to create uniform class. And if plasma is uniform, it's not damaging aurora borealis, you will not kill anybody with lightning, you will. That allows you not damaging to now start allowing plasma to interact with the human body. Some parts of treating tissues, for example. Yes. Why is that interesting work? Oh, yeah. What kind of applications are we talking about? OK, today the biggest application is related to treatment of chronic wounds like ulcers, especially diabetic ulcers. Also recently treatment of cancers because our plasma sources are permitted to be used during surgery. So when like a surgeon is making a surgery, he removes cancer, but some margins are not treated. So they start using this plasma just to remove tissue, but tissue without damage because it instead of like a scalpel, it's like a jet, small jet for once. It's a very effective generation of stimulation of angiogenesis. So just growing old blood vessels. So that's, I would say, two most successful applications today. What plasma related Nobel Prizes do you think will be given in the next 50 years? So if you look at the big ideas in plasma, what do you think? Is there to be discovered, understood or may have already been understood and and will be recognized for. OK, closer to our field, at least, where we are playing that if we are fielders. I would say called plasma for magical, logical applications, I would say if there is a significant actually accepted by FDA, etc., success in treatment of cancer. There is a big chance to get a Nobel Prize. What discipline would you get at all the medicine in medicine? That's fascinating. Yeah, that's fascinating. Ed, is this another example which I like a lot? Personally, it is this plasma sanitisation of liquids without bubbles. There's a chance also to get Nobel Prize for that because it's first of all, it's a fascinating physics, ionization of liquid as our bubbles. What's the nature of the bubbles, the form if you take liquid and put like a two electrodes in the liquid to ionized liquid, you need huge electric field. At least that's what most people they used to think because I mean, free passes, small for electrons, they they have to be accelerated to have this huge energy. So it's either electric field is huge or there's enough distance through to accelerate. Now you have liquid. That's not much place to go. So you have to have about a thousand times greater electric field or you have to create some voids. If you create voids inside of Libya, that's OK. Now, that's what people they used to believe. But the maybe about five, seven years ago. People there understood that even when they have very high electric people, but not a huge they start having. Ionisation of liquid, so just the same as the plasma in fluorescent lamps, but they have the same thing in liquid. And first of all, it's very interesting physics. It's a longer story to explain. It's very interesting physics, but also a very interesting application because you have a possibility to have called. Plasma inside of liquid, so you can synthesize new materials, you can do something. So that's was the reason why I came a couple of history making this presentation of these discharges and creation of this in the creation of polymeric nitrogen. Because people they don't have nitrogen polymers today, and that's in cold plasma that was synthesized. So it is very interesting from a fundamental point of view of synthetic chemistry. But nobody were able to make this kind of change from language. Right. So that was created, which is very interesting. Now, this material. It's normal conditions. Is converted back to regular nitrogen, releasing huge energy, way more than any explosive materials. So, OK, so those are two interesting ideas. Yeah, those close to your heart. What about what about the sun? What about hot thermal plasma? Do you think there's an interesting open problems there that will help us understand the universe or something like that? I don't think so. Today. There is no I think for for thermal plasma, there is very low chance for a normal price kind of results. However, there is a so-called fusion plasma. So plasma because the thermal plasma, which we discussed is a thermal engineering plasma, it's almost like a melting welding. These kind of applications, coatings and surface of the sun, surface of the sun. But if you go to higher temperatures, you have fusion, nuclear fusion. But if in normal plasma thermal plasma temperatures, about 10000 Kelvin, 10000 for fusion, you have to have 100 million. So it's more so inside the sun. Is it deeply inside? And the physics there is interesting physics is extremely interesting because it's a lot of stability and this plasma, this discount, if temperatures behave very different. So it is it is, I would say, superfluity material. So you just it's it's do you think there's possible breakthroughs in terms of using fusion as an energy source or somehow, you know, that kind of like crazy ideas were out there ideas. But on this podcast, I talked to people about aliens and traveling across the universe. So if you want to travel across the universe, you're going to have to. My feeling is that. My feeling is that like a fusion plasma in its traditional way, which was started in my Sahara in 1953. Almost no chances. Well, I mean, they have it they have it already, but the system is so complicated, the stock markets, the big eater, because it's so complicated, so difficult, that personally it's difficult for me to believe that it will be like a real energy generating plants. So this is being able to control fusion in order to leverage it. Yeah, I just they try already for how many years about Foxygen? That's an interesting point. That's what I'm trying to say. And that I am almost sure that at some point, hopefully soon, it will be a young one, not so much young, but usually young. Out of the box thinking person who hey, guys, take a look, did it. Something like cold fusion, something called fusion, you know, there's a lot of guys and girls like that who are called crazy, who have been talking about cold fusion for decades. Yeah. So you think you hope that there is a breakthrough idea that might. Yes. Yes, I'm I'm almost sure about that. And I can't explain you simple physics, if it's it will take 40 seconds, 30. It won't take longer, but OK. OK, I mean, take a look. Take a look. What is fusion. You take the theory of 3-2 or the theory of deuterium. You bring them together. And they fuse and your research gets it right. The problem is that this is and this is either positively charged and we have to bring them extremely close. And energy required for that is 10, 100 million degrees. That's what they try to do now. Now, take a look. Why? We have to bring them so much closer, we can bring them a little bit and it will tunnelling so they will start regaining it require more time. Yes, but that's OK. But to do that, you have to have a smaller sizes. You have to have dense matter, maybe. 30, 40, 50 times denser than what we have now, how to do that, they have to replace electron by something very similar to electron, but heavier muons. If you do that immediately, something becomes smaller and you start having called normal fuel. But like a production and reproduction of this material is kind of complicated. People, they're trying what I'm trying to say, that somebody will come up with an interesting out of the box. Solution, that's what I believe. Well, you're right, a lot of people are a little bit to say not professional. They just say, oh, look, I did it. But but between these people or between serious scientists thinking out of the box, something will happen. Tokamak, yes, they work, but there's too much complicated. It's very difficult to keep 100 million degrees for and be a long time. Just very difficult, beautiful. You know, whatever you do, that Nobel Prize without any question. OK, I guess if you could give me the OK refill here just to make sure we're doing OK. We talked about coming to NASA. You OK? Doing three hours and we talked about the journey to America a little bit. But let's take a step back. It seems like an unlikely journey that has to do with a bunch of different factors, ideas, hopes and dreams and goals and plans. Why did we move to America as a family? Can you tell the story there narrowly and broadly as our big family? That's a lot of details, a lot of, like, interesting stuff which happened at the same time together. First of all, I was already in France most of time, which made the decision easier to go to America. But absolutely significant role was played by Kaplan's family. What was the captain's family? Yeah, it is. Our last name is Friedemann. Yes. Paying attention to what's called Kaplin. It's it's the name of our of your grand grandmother. Yours, my grandmother. My great grandmother. Your great grandmother. So her name was Karpovich. And when her family came to America, they changed names to Kaplan's and it was forbidden to contact family during that period to reach outside the country, the Soviet Union to. So there's this big family. Well, not that I'm not big, but now Big Kaplin family, they came to the States and my father, he your grandfather had this interesting picture on there without much hopes. He wrote a letter without speaking English. And you saw this letter where it is said like a Jew newspaper it and the word Jew was g g g w yeah. Newspaper, Cincinnati, it America and all. It got to its destination. And that's like a miracle. Yeah. That the letter came to this tonight. And it's interesting because the newspaper published the letter. Yeah. Yeah. That's uh it's kind of American and that. Yeah. It's uh it's a miracle. So that's the miracle. They gave a catalyst. That was a catalyst. Yeah. It was an excellent connection. And just as a result, you know, we met and just and it was a catalyst for me to accept the position already from friends position of a full professor in the New York of Illinois and Chicago. And that's actually how we moved to Chicago. So did you ever think that you would come to America? Honestly, no. Even with my good friends, we were usually talking and my plans when I understand that it's better for a scientist to go like outside of the Soviet Union Europe than you would go to France. And my choice was clearly France. And we usually say that I spoke with a captain, that I always say that I will go to France. I had well and I want to go to America, but actually happened all the way up. So, uh, yes, OK. I spoke with better French language. Yeah. And I started speaking French there in French that there was there was there was an alternate reality where we moved to France. And I'm French. Yeah. And you're French. And chances for that were very high 50/50 kind of thing. A I mean, I remember there being is pretty certain that we're going to France. Yeah. It was more than 50 percent. Yeah. Because we have already I mean it was very very hijos. Yeah. You remember the picture I show we were there with various French people without incident if you remember. I just remember, like I was mentioning Husky and he loves you. He used to like oh he's alive. Yeah. Yeah. And he plays very nice piano. Yeah. It's a very, very nice people and it's a different world of scientists. Um, perhaps more pure in their pursuit of science. Uh, more support for the kind of labs in the spirit of the scientific process. It's America's academic research system is a little bit more capitalistic, I guess, in an American professor spends about fifty percent of time looking for funding and they're a little bit more independent, meaning their own little startup, more it's very difficult to do an institute and so on. Speaking of which, I don't know how I forgot to mention, but the institute your you've headed the Drexel the Nijem Plasma Institute for a long time from 2002, from 2000 to what was that journey like of all the many brilliant people that have worked there through the years? All the different ideas having an institute in America is an interesting thing in itself. If all the other was that journey been like. Wow, it was very exciting and very challenging, and I would say that I work very hard, but I would say I was very much lucky that I was able to bring. Who is me? Nice group of people with a Néstor Gazal poshness and more recently, redeterminations, and then to bring in the like now and then others. So it was a lot of people and they were good. And it was a very nice feeling of how to say. Camaraderie, camaraderie. Yeah, not including including Greg, who made a huge contribution to that Namath's. So it is like a family, my brother. Yeah. And I've been on the outside of that sort of looking in. So I know a lot of these people there. And there's almost like a part of family. I know they're part of our story in America and know. Yeah. How do we have a handsome and I member of my plasma institute. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah you had. Don't be shy. No, no. No fear. No fear. Yeah. Don't be shy. Go ahead and be inspired. You write that. Yeah. I know that that eighth grade your poetry has been going down downhill and you know, and I mean we talk about that a lot that writing poetry in English actually much more difficult. It's um and hence why it's not as popular. It's now more popular, I guess, through in music, through hip hop, through rap, that that's the popular kind of poetic the writing is in America. Very different. Basically in France it is way closer to Russian. The French language allows for yare French language that allows for this like a song oriented poetry. What would you say? Is the difference between the Soviet Union and America that kind of. It maybe to ask in another way, what do you miss about the Soviet Union, about Russia, about Ukraine? You see that while? Me and other people which came in our generation, each came from Russia, Ukraine, Soviet Union, we just we were not happy, absolutely not happy with the political system over there. But I would say without any exception, we are all, I would say, deeply in love with Russian culture. Which is absolutely unique and absolutely beautiful and my and my feeling that while I like American culture also but her passion is way closer to my heart and I think it's way richer. The same thing is approach to science, which in Russia was very its first of all, I like it because I was younger, which is always nice to be young. But, you know, this kind of feeling of science is more important than everything else. And being the professor, it is the most prestigious profession. That's kind of interesting culture. But but the political system was not good and now it's also challenging. But what do you think about Putin? Putin, sorry to interrupt, Putin came to power after we left, yeah, 2000 year 2000. Exactly. You remember this moment when we were in Miami Beach, New Year's New Year? It was exactly the day when Putin became a president. Because absolutely unexpectedly, one day before that. It was like a New Year greeting from a president at the time, Boris Yeltsin, and he said Happy holidays, happy new Year, guys. And you know what? I decided to step down. Oops. And just I want to. Another person to lead the country during transition period, and then we have elections, so that's today. So we talk and I in different ways also love certain parts of Russia, and they're still a part of me, even though it's I didn't spend them more than 13 years or whatever. But Putin represents modern Russia. So that's why I asked if you know where we're Americans now. Really. But what do you think about this man who's carrying who's defining the 21st century Russia? I would say there is a two phrases, two sayings which come into my mind. You see, you gave me 10 seconds to think, which is important. There is a saying the ends justify the means. You know who said that? It's there is a book here. It's a it's a Macchiavelli. Oh, this is basically his sculpture. Well the the the the head the yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. But straight it's a Machiavelli in the book Prince he said that the ends justify the means. Another phrase. It's another nice guy, Maximilian Robespierre. He used to say you cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs on a paper. Feltham them letters. And I said yeah that's a Robespierre. And these two phrases actually they describe for me at least. Putin, you know, that his way of thinking is it was a huge catastrophe because I think for a second the huge Soviet Union were Russians. They were everywhere, Russian people, Russian, Russian and enduring a short period of time. Bunz it is a 15 independent countries. Well, now and and Mike, significant, I don't know, I would say almost half OK or less than half, but there are a significant number of Russians. They become like us people living in other countries, not very much friendly to Russia. So he put all his efforts to change it, to to make it easier and better. That's and this is the ends. We justifies means and he's breaking a lot of eggs and he's making a lot of not good steps, but for the good purpose. Now, just what I keep thinking, that Russian empire, it is not the first empire to disappear. Now, take a look what happened to other empires, French Empire. Oh, my gosh, they had enormously problems, very similar to Putin. And you know who was there? Putin. It was the guerrilla because in the late 1950s, it was an enormous war in Algeria and the whole group of Maghreb countries. And you know what happened, they just even stopped the republic and they create absolutely new constitution. And it was actually absolute disaster in late 1950s or early 1960s, but they actually went out faster than Russia. Well, why? It's a different story. Now, take a look. Another huge the biggest empire in the world. It's a British. They lost their empire and huge number of British people. They just stay somewhere. The same thing like Soviet Union. But interesting enough, they they they made it. They made like these other countries which get rid of British Empire, but they were still in love. With the queen, they become part of this commonwealth and it was relatively smooth, so British, they did excellent job. French terms like all these in, you know, yeah, yeah, but but Russia so far doing not good. So they're just they they try to help. They try to make this kind of. But they break a lot of eggs. Should I interview Putin on this podcast? He's he's a very interesting personality, he's very smart and try but. Sure, but we're going to talk about because power. Future of Russia. Future of Russia and is great, and it's right, no, no, no, not not not in those kinds of questions, but in the kind of. Omelette and eggs way and. In the space of. Technology, sort of innovation of science, of becoming a superpower again, which is where you have to, you know, the space race, you would like this kind of discussion, because what I know about him, basically, he supports the platform medicine, billionaire class members. Yes. Because when he defined like a three or whatever four major directions of development of science, he mentioned both artificial intelligence and plasma medicine. Yeah, OK. Interesting how. He really. Thinks that the end justifies the means. So he's not afraid to make any kind of decision but to make countries stronger. And and he did, actually. He did a very good job from the point of view of. Like, you know, all other republics, they were saying that all our problems because of Russia, because Russia can say that all these problems because of, yeah, he took responsibility, but with power authoritarians, power can is very useful. But it can also cloud your judgment. You can slowly become a lesser man than you could have otherwise been without being checked. So too complicated. And Slaney has brought the complicated, interesting story so you can compare him with Maximiliano this year. So without a microphone between us, we often talk about artificial intelligence. We have a lot of opinions. Like you said, you always think you're right and you're right. You know, barely half of the time I'm right. Absolutely always. With the exception of cases. Yeah. When I'm wrong or wrong. Which never happens because it hasn't been observed. OK, so let me get your profound deep opinions about artificial intelligence. Do you think we'll ever build systems that are as intelligent or more intelligent than human beings in the same kind of way that we think humans are intelligent? You know, the most important, it's the last remark which you made. I strongly believe in artificial intelligence. I believe that it will be a lot of development in the direction of like a human similarity to human. But I very much doubt about artificial consciousness, this kind of stuff. From my point of view, it's very questionable. So I don't know what is consciousness to you. Consciousness, it's it's way more. It's the wider stuff, it's like a life, it's a complex of feelings. It's a complex of feelings like intelligence, it's smartness, it's knowledge, it's a possibility to operate with knowledge, consciousness, it's it's knowledge, but we matched together with feelings. Do you think science will ever be able to understand consciousness? So here I believe I believe that sooner or later, at least in this direction will be big breakthroughs. So do you think. Do you think he'll be able to put consciousness inside a Roomba, inside a phone, inside a camera device's consciousness consciousness? I don't know, you know, like a Jewish answer to most of the questions. I mean, we don't know yet. We don't know. I mean, I it's very difficult to predict what will happen with science. In 300 years, it's like to ask 300 years ago in what, in 1970, 100. Come on, it's way before Napoleon. Yeah, the Internet is 11 years of its last years of luchadores, whatever, Ludovic 14th. And you ask them about cell phones. What do what do you do if you ask we catalyser if you ask him a question, what he thinks about cell phones. He will say. Rishi. Colossally, I am a fan king. I know you're simplifying because perhaps, perhaps, perhaps because it is, in other words, cell phone. But if I ask them about artificial intelligence, then explained it correctly, he would actually have an opinion. Already they've had opinions about these kinds of things. Yeah, yeah. Sort of can. Man, this is a fundamental philosophical question. Can human beings create artificial versions of themselves with Frankenstein then? Many people have been thinking when you build up statues, it's a and people have been maybe not Jews, but people have been confidently providing answers. OK, what I can tell you, my feeling is, yes, artificial person will be created. OK, so the question is. How close it will be like this synthetic synthetic person will be with respect to reality? Is it good or bad? It's just different, but it is doable. So we have this disagreement a lot. And you think that. So do you think such a system needs to have a body? And our disagreement is often about the census. You seem to have a full really experience of consciousness. You smell touch. Yeah. So and I say you can do just words, words and the image, not even just words, but yes, image is helpful, but words, even just the words voice. OK, you know, like don't forget I lived many years in France so for me smell. Like a Armagnac, I mean, smell is very much even more important than taste. Yeah, but image can be even less important. So just taste and smell. So what I'm trying to say that they mean, but if I give you an option, I had to kill all your senses except one, which one would you like to stay with? I would not. You know, that's not a good question. I think a question. If you have a choice to kill your father or mother, what you would do? I mean, it's not father. Well, but what I'm trying to say that it's my feeling it's moralistic that people they can lose one of feelings. It's OK. But, yeah, that's true. And yes, that's not life. But you think consciousness, it's it's actually it's a book including, like you said, consciousness is a book. I like it. But you think a system should have a sense of smell, sense of touch, and that my feeling is that it's not so difficult to do. Yes. From so this is where we have disagreements and debates and software versus hardware. I mean, you're much more comfortable with hardware and and taste and smell these kinds of things that it's it's almost like a sensor. It's a chemistry problem. Yeah. But for me, actually, I'm from Harmony. I'm not saying this is hardware software. Yeah. I would say that that's start the book in these cases. It's the harmony. Harmony. Yeah. No, I guess I come from a world that's a very kind of AI world and computer science world where you think that most of the problems in the world can be converted into a ninety nine percent software problem. And that's, that's the dream because it's easier then. But, uh, but you know, it was a Russian comedian. Absolutely beautiful. Netsky maybe I remember him. Maybe not. Hmm. He used to say in Russian, the latest footage of the streets, which is not acceptable. What does it mean? Well, how can you translate it into English? Let's not don't even try. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. But what I'm trying to say that this is a point is is it possible to describe with the words. Taste of oysters, if you never, ever tried. And that's a very important moment. Sometimes this big data and artificial intelligence, they say, OK, we don't need Smout, we can describe what has been described, the smell. It means that they can collect data about like a smell of cheese and put it in like a huge database. And based on that, to help you to choose what is the best chase without smelling. So this in this case, I have to recommend to this computer or to this computer scientist. To think about the Schnittke and this argument about. Taste of oysters. Without trying them at least once in their life. Yes, that's why I think the taste and smell should be also important. Yeah, I disagree because I think it it that I agree that's very important. But I believe our mind and artificial minds will be able to fill in the gaps without being able to smell you. You start without ever having tasted or smelled oysters. You start imagining smell and taste. It won't be connected to reality at all, but you construct a world that's consistent. So I would say in this case, it's not artificial intelligence, it's synthetic intelligence. And I prefer artificial because in the artificial heart. Yeah, you know what I mean. So and synthetic means like. Yeah, you synthesized something. Yeah, it's no there's no it's it's lacking of the human experience and artificial has that art. Yes. Well. You might you might be right, because the only intelligence system we have now has smell. Oh, really? Oh, OK. So very good. I like it. Do you think about mortality, your own mortality? Yes. Because. There is a three elements to that. One. Like, I'm a normal person and I think about that. Especially in relation to his parents when you lost your dad. Yes, and mom also. So, you know, you you cannot let something which happened to everybody at some point when you lose your father and mother, you understand it. Now it's you. You're next. That's it. It's well, that's human. The second element, what I think about is religion, because at least for me, but for many people also like going to beliefs of your parents, grandparents, etc.. Helps, helps. And you start to understand the older you are, the closer you are to to this moment, the more you just feel it's the role of religion is huge. And number three, I'm a scientist. And a couple of weeks ago had a long discussion on the conference. About immortality at the walls of this cosmetic meeting, because I mentioned to you that with this LVMH like a little bit on the weather and Hennesy, that's the important one. And we have been talking about like a possibility to change direction of aging. And this is one of challenges which actually in the beginning of plasma medicine, we start trying to do. And it was like a kind of serious experiment, trying to using plasma to to the aging process. I can explain you with more details, but it's a longer story. But as a result of this experiments, unfortunately, we show that in all 100 percent of like experiments we did, we actually accelerated aging not. But maybe we have to get ideas. You might be able to from a scientific perspective. And there is there is a solution because you know, that mortality, it just God or nature put it in as this mortality in which we we have stem cells and they just, you know, providing differentiation. Which is like reinnervation of us, like when there is a tiny small kid, he changed his nose, I don't know, each couple of days. So just it's it's always like a renovation of the tissue. Yes. Death and birth. Death and birth. Yeah. Yes, you should. Like I thought, like a nose is like growing noise just like this each time I have a new one. Now when. In your age. Like simplifying, it happened less often, maybe once in, I don't know, five, ten years, but for me and fortunately are functioning like I will stay with this note forever now. So the only thing we have to do, actually, is just to add this cell stem cell. They are still there. We just but their efficiency is for some not very much known reason when. Down, down, down, down, down, down. So what they have to do, we have to actually help these stem cells stimulate them just to to become, again, more active. And if we do that and plus medicine tried, then just, you know, instead of getting older and older, will go back younger and younger. It is possible, yes, it's against the law of nature, no. So this is third way to think about that, but that's a real challenge. Interesting that it was a discussion on this subject was Levithan. If science does arrive at that breakthrough, if you could live forever, would you would you like to live forever? I think, yes, I would try. Why not? You know, let's I'll give you a reason not. Is it makes a life, you know, the fact that stuff ends gives it some deep meaning. You know, Jewish people, basically. They are deeply, deeply, deeply in love with. Life, you know, they say hi to life, so Jewish people, they. I actually believe that God gave us life to enjoy what will happen, will have another life or not. Or maybe it will be like again will be young. Is it possible the Jewish answer is absolutely clear? We don't know so but enjoying life, it's a long. Absolutely. So if you have possibility to leave. You have to go on with life. That's a Jewish answer, and I like it. Are you afraid of death? Yes, I remember when you ask me, how long did it take for me to fall in love with your mother? One, two, three. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You answer that pretty quickly. So what do you think is the meaning of life? Oh, that's a difficult question. You never like this, the silly questions go back to your eighth grade self and be romantic for a second. Yeah. What's the meaning of life and meaning of our existence here in this little. Planet, well, I remember that I kept asking myself this question when I was in eighth grade, it was one of the crucial question for me at that time by the exactly the same time when I wrote this, yeah, I'm writing staff. And at the time I remember my answer. I kept saying day by day. Which means. The meaning of life is just to enjoy, enjoy today's life and go to tomorrow. Survive the day, enjoy the day and eat your French existentialists, your smarter and smarter, it's but you know, at that time I didn't have any. Knowledge about existentialists, whatever. Yeah, especially subtle, but I was absolutely sure about that, if you ask me now, I would say. I was right. I thought I thought that was a natural extension of the axiom, which is always right. Yes, yes, yes, but, you know, in each joke, it's a 50 percent of joke, 50 percent not. But after reading it was a book, more awards, right? What's an English? You say S. S words slower. I think in this book, you just when I read that, it's amazingly absolutely badass. Booklet. Yes, Hatchers. I prefer camo and the other French guy. Yeah. I just decided I was not alone with this kind of ideas. Yeah. There's other French guys. What do you hope Greg and I accomplish in life? And next, I'll ask you for advice, and after that, we'll drink some vodka. Why are you calculating? I know I'm not calculating and just trying to recall very nice poetry. You know, between I I love Russian poetry, and it's interesting that my favorite Russian poet, it's actually a woman, it's a Marine at the time, and she wrote like a short poetry, just saying that she said nationalists in Russia, Paul Nevo in that assumes that if you decide maybe she's poised. This week is Thursday three. Well, and it is a Russian, but I am. I think that it's kind of deep and it kind of smart, we wish I wish you to be happy and I know that if I push in some direction. Our Greg. That's nothing happened. I mean, I OK, I will be always recommending you always push. And don't forget, I'm always pushing anyway. But you know that and I have to do that because I'm a father. So I am. And I'm always pushing in conservative direction. Because because I am a father and I very much wish you to have your son, my grandson or granddaughter. Yeah. And I almost guarantee you that we'll do the same. You will not recommend your daughter to take a risk and to go to Hollywood to try to be an actress. She's supposed to do it without without your permission. What? And that's that's that's beautiful. We make our own way, and you always have given me brilliant advice that I almost never follow and usually disagree with. So but and that's the way it should be. Yeah, that's the way of life. Well, so what? Speaking of which, what advice do you have for me for. The next 10, 20 years in life. Sort of in any direction. You see? I'm. Hesitating, I'm thinking about I mean, I have two ideas, and they're kind of very much opposed. Yeah. So for one hand, my approach was the same as the soldiers. On one hand, I like the idea just to live your life and to enjoy. And to be prepared for tomorrow, which everything will restart again from one hand, from another hand. I remember myself in. Elementary school, you remember beginning of our discussion about these stupid guys, these idiots with stones, and I just had an idea just to build a rocket. Who to put there? So I wanted to do and I did it, so this is another idea when you just put your heart into something for a longer time, not for one day, but you have to find your own way. Just and my feeling is that you personally. Pounded with artificial intelligence, and that's why my feeling is that in your specific case, my advice will be just not to let this idiots with tools to succeed, you have to deliver. Yeah, and that's what I figured. And that's what I mean with the mercury in the rocket. But build the rocket. It's your choice. Yeah, because that's the rocket which you're building. But what is important? That'll do it. Well, I think this is a good time. To, uh, to maybe toast our family. Oh, they some we thought we'll do we'll probably drink more vodka, but we decided to be responsible adults and just save the vodka to the. And it's always a question, how much what could we have to drink? In Russian tradition, usually we calculate for adults like a one bottle per one bottle per person. Take a look at his made in Soviet Union, and it's 1986. This is what kind of my father, because in 1986, in the year of Chernobyl, he gave this bottle to a friend of mine because this friend of mine, he went to America and he just this my friend, he just saved this vodka for us to be able to just whatever to think about his name of my friend. Oh, he's Sasha. But we call him Shora. Sure. But that's the same thing as your best friend. Your lifelong friend. Yes. It's like your math. My met I met her and he shut up. And first you can toast a family, but let me just toast to the best that I've ever had, the best that I could ever ask for. I love you. That I love you. Let's go.

#122 – David Fravor: UFOs, Aliens, Fighter Jets, and Aerospace Engineering, The following is a conversation with Commander David Fraser, who was a Navy pilot for 18 years and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41, also known as the Black Aces Squadron of 12 airplanes consisting of several hundred people. He's also famously one of the people who, with his own eyes, saw and chased a UFO unidentified flying object in 2004 that is referred to as the Tic-Tac and the incident more formally referred to as the USS Nimitz UFO incident. His story corroborated by several other pilots. From my perspective as a curious scientist and an open minded human being is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history, at least that I'm aware of. He's a humble, fascinating and fun human being to talk to. I put out a call for questions on Reddit and many other places and tried to ask as many of the questions that people posted as I could. And overall, I really enjoyed this conversation. And I'm sure if the world wants us to and if there's more questions to be had, we'll talk on this podcast again. Quick summary of the sponsors.

As a side note, let me say that the world of UFOs and UMP's unidentified aerial phenomena and aliens in general is foreign to me because of the high ratio of outlandish conspiracy theorists to actual hard evidence. I'm a scientist first and foremost, but an open minded one, often looking and thinking outside the box. I'm often disheartened by the closed mindedness of the scientific community and in equal part, I'm disheartened by the lack of rigour and basic scientific inquiry and study on the part of the conspiracy theorists. I believe there's a line somewhere between the two extremes that more inquisitive minds should walk. I think we humans know very little about our world, what's up there among the stars and the nature of reality and the nature of our very own minds. The path to understanding can only be walked humbly, the very idea that there is a possibility that David witnessed a piece of technology, whether human made or alien made that moved in the way he did, should be inspiring to every scientist and engineer on this earth. There may be propulsion and energy systems yet to be discovered that, once understood and mastered, will put distant galaxies within reach of US human beings. Paradigm shifts in science and leaps in understanding can only happen, I think, if we open our eyes and allow ourselves to dream, to think from first principles and remove the constraints on innovation placed on us by the scientific inventions and assumptions of prior generations.

This show is brought to you by a lot of greens that all in one daily drink to support health and performance. I drink it every day to make sure I'm not missing any of the nutrition I need. Now let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting. I fast, often, sometimes intermittent fasting of sixteen hours and then an eight hour eating period of two meals, sometimes twenty four hours. That's one dinner to the next. I've been even considering doing a 48 or 72 hour fast that some people I look up to have done. People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss and the different health benefits, the chance to meditate on the finiteness of life, not eating somehow is a reminder that we're immortal, that every day is precious. I certainly experience this with the twenty four hour fast and I think it goes even deeper for the 48, 72 and even week long. Fast anyway. I always break my fast with a lot of greens. It's delicious, refreshing. It makes me feel good. So good. Athletic greens. That council likes to claim a special offer of free vitamin D for a year. Again, go to the Greens.

The natural question is, if I could, what would I bring to this island? The answer is complicated. But let me pick one thing. The first thing that popped into my crazy mind, which is the introduction to Algorithm's book, also called Clarus for the first letters of the last name of the four authors I find algorithm's beautiful, like a little toolbox for a simple world inside computers when the real world outside is an impossible, chaotic mess. I would love pondering the puzzles in that book for months far away from human civilization.

You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School. Yeah, I am, but are known as Top Gun. Let me maybe ask the most ridiculous question. How realistic is the movie Top Gun? So it's funny. We used to joke and I and a friend of mine who is a Top Gun instructor said there's two things in the original Top Gun that are true, that are very realistic. One, there is a place called Top Gun. And number two is they do fly airplanes are. Other than that, you know, I went through in seven class four ninety seven. And there's actually a log of every single person that's went through, kind of like seal training. You know, there's a list. So people because there's a lot of posers out there. I was a Navy SEAL. They weren't. Well, I went to Top Gun. You can actually go to Top Gun, in matter of fact, just to get a top gun patch, the real patch, you have to have gone there. So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real. There's the real ones are controlled, the people that make them honor that. And when you go in, they look up your name. If you want to get one, they look up your name. You just tell them like, OK, here and LSP, if you are not on the list, you can get no badge because it is it's a pretty big deal to go through. But it's, for me, one of the best experiences of flying because everyone there is extremely competent. It's very, very challenging, but it's what we all signed up to do. So it's it's just the entire group. That is when you want to be that, you know, that level, you know where you go, everyone really cares and everyone really wants to be good. Is it competitive like it was in the movie or. No, it's when you go through it's you know, it's if anything, it's more of the students, you know, and then there's the instructor side and the instructor sides are really, you know, they're guys that, you know, they just chose to stay up. And Phalen and it's extremely difficult job because they have they have a very small tolerance for. Not being good, so they're Breece, the guys, when they give a lecture, so let's just say there's a fight or employment lecture, which is one of the hardest ones. It takes about two days to give the fighter employment lecture. The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple what they call a murder boards where he scrutinized by his peers and he practices by the time they actually stand in front of a class, they pretty much have their two hundred and fifty PowerPoint slides memorized and they don't even turn around. They just click and they know them in order and they repeat the same thing over and it's standardized. So they are extremely, extremely standardized. When you go through the school. And there's a reason for that because what they're doing is they're training. So when you come out of Top Gun, you're called a strike fighter, weapons and tactics instructor. So your safety, when you come out of that, your job is to go usually to one of the weapon schools on the east or West Coast and train the fleet squadrons. And then you visit the squadrons and train and do upgrade rides and all that. So there's a there's a reason that they are extremely particular. When you go through the course, it's it is literally one of the best things. And it's not it's not a rank based thing because think, oh, maybe you can come in as a you know, like an 004 lieutenant commander, the lieutenants, the hierarchy will cease to be. I don't know how it is exactly today, but I imagine it's the same. The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school, not necessarily rank. So one of the tactical decisions are made, which are based on fact and trying things out in the Phalen Ranges. They set the top X number of folks that have been there seniority wise and I mean time wise are the ones that actually make the decision. And when the door you may not agree, but when the door opens and everyone comes out from the staff, they all speak the same language. It's and it has to be that way, which is why the school has been so effective since it was founded. So it's just a it's an incredible group, individuals. So there's a bar of excellence that that the instructors demand. Well, very much so. And they're held to it. So it's not a hey, I'm now an instructor so I can do what I want. There is a standard and they have to live up to that standard. They have to and I mean every moment of every day. So if they go someplace, if they go from Phalen and they come down and do they're called site visits where they come down and they'll come Tullamore, California, which is where the West Coast Fighter Wing is at for the Navy. And they go around and start flying sorties with the fleet squadrons to kind of pass on some of that knowledge. That's that same high level of standard. It's they can't just drop your guard because you wear the top gun patch and people know that. And they were light blue shirts. So it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there. And, you know, and then everyone else who's been through the school, including them, have the patch on their sleeve. So there's a standard that's expected when you come out of there. So you're a Navy pilot for eight years. Yes. Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot? Yeah. So, you know, first I was when I was enlisted, I was a Marine and then the Marines actually sent me, recommended me to go to the Naval Academy. So it's always better to be lucky than good. But I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished and I had that dream to fly. So when I got selected, I've always dreamed of flying. Yeah. Since nineteen sixty nine. When I watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon, I was at that point I asked my mom, I remember watching it, I was from I was just prior to being five and I said. So cool, Mom, and she said, well, you know, they were all pilots, and then at that point it was like, I'm going to be a pilot. And if you knew me growing up because I was a little bit of a delinquent, people are just like you. All right. I used to joke I'm going to fly. I'm going to fly jets. I'm going to drop bombs then. And if people that knew him as a kid, they would be like, yeah. And they'd be like, oh, not a chance. And then when I did, I actually had a funny story and I'll get to it and I'll finish my career. But I was at my cousin's wedding and we all grew up in the same neighborhood, but we kind of had Italian side of the family. That's how we grew up. So it was my house. Right down the street is my cousin Chad, and right around the corner is my cousin Ray and my aunts and uncles and stuff. The guy two doors down from me and I was a paper boy in the neighborhood. So they all knew me. And I went to my cousin's wedding and he and Mr. Reese looks at me and he says, David Frazier, I go, Mr. Reese, how are you doing? You fly jets, top gun and all that. I go, sir, I figured he'd be in jail by now. And it was kind of to me it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on and I kind of overcame that. But what do you attribute that to? So you I've heard you before and just now say that. But maybe it's better to be lucky than good. And you talk modestly about just being lucky, but. If you were to describe your trajectory maybe in the way of advice, like retrospectively. How'd you pull it off to be like to be truly a special person, the easiest way is one never, never take no, don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it or those. I mean, I knew I knew what I was capable of inside, you know? And if I really believe if you want something and you want to do something, then you can achieve it. Not in all cases. Like if I loved basketball and I really want it to be in the NBA, there's a realism that says I'm five foot eight and I got like a really short vertical leap and I'm really not that good at basketball. Probably not ever going to happen no matter how hard I try and practice. It's just the way it is or for me to be in the NFL. I'm not fast, you know, I'm not that big. It just physically I'm incapable of doing that. But there's things that don't really tie to a true physical ability as far as size and strength, but it's mental. And I'm not saying you have to be a genius and super smart to be a fighter pilot. Matter of fact, you don't it really comes down to the ability to think very quickly. 80 percent solution is typically good enough because if you overthink it, you're you're behind. And then in an air to air fight, that's what happens. People try and overthink it. And before you know it, because it's happening so fast, you don't have you can't get to the nth degree. You know, six decimal places, 80 percent solution is good enough for the really strong good for the 80 percent solution. Just yeah, I'm a big believer in 80 percent solution. I love that if you go and then you can always adjust, which is exactly what like if you're fighting and BFM, the 80 percent solution is it's like a chess game, but it's a really, really fast chess game where you go, I'm doing this and and I know that if I do a maneuver, if he's going to counter it correctly, he should do a if he doesn't do a, he does some degree less like BCD. And then I know how bad his his error is. And then I capitalize. So my my I don't have to be perfect, you know, I have to go, I need to go to forty seven degrees nose high. If I just kind of get above 40 then I'm good and I can watch over X and then I can adjust for that. And you continually work that problem and you chip away because if you start neutral you're just basically chipping away and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage to eventually you know, if you're really, you know, fighting, you know, just guns only recorder where you got to get behind the guy kind of World War to dog fighting type stuff, then it's it's literally it's a it's a very, very fast chess game that happens at, you know, 400 knots, 300 knots depends. So to get to be one of the rare individuals that are able to do that, he just had the dream and didn't take no for an answer. Yeah, well, you know you know, part of it is family. You know, my dad was I am a fire ready aim guy. You know, he'd smack me and then asked me what I did wrong. Good parenting back then. You know, I joke and people look because, you know, times it was kind of tough, you know, because he can be pretty demanding. But on the other side, you know, I probably needed to be reined in a little bit at times. But then everyone else, my family, you know, my mom was really awesome when I was a kid, my my grandfather, who is a big, big part of it, my mom's dad, who he taught me a lot. And when you have a question there that we'll talk about, about him, but huge, huge influence, very, very positive. And a lot of the stuff that I do today and decisions are based on things that he taught me. And, you know, and I figured, you know, it was the first funeral ever went to and it was is about three miles long and church was overfilling and people were out. He was a beer delivery guy, dead serious. And you go, there's someone else who died, the pope. So a lot of people loved them. So back to back to my career because I'm getting down a rabbit hole. No, I when I was at the I was going to I was going to stay in the Marines, I really wanted to go. And I love the Corps. I think it's EVOL Services. It's that one. Everything is in a ball. And they're very, very professional. And it was a great, great organization to join. But I went out to the Nimitz on my freshman cruise. After your freshman year at the Naval Academy, you go out on a ship and you you're an enlisted person. You get to experience that half when I was enlisted. So it's fine with me because it comes up a lot. I'm saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is like. Yeah. So Nimitz is an aircraft carrier, so it's four and a half acres of sovereign U.S. territory. It floats around the US oceans or the giant thing. Does it have weapons on it? The air wing is really the weapons. It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part, it's a giant moving airport is what it is. So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off and I'm like, oh, and the squadrons that were out there, one of the squadrons was VF forty one and a fourteen squadron VF 84 and a fourteen squadron and then a couple of a six squadrons. And we actually ended up pairing up and hanging out with some of the pilots. So it was really a neat experience and I said. I want to do that, and the way to do it was to not to to go in the Navy because there are Marine squadrons that go out to the aircraft carriers, but most of them are land based, you know, to support the Marines, because that that unit, that whole unit, the Marine Corps is at one service has it all. And so when I graduated and I got to you know, I worked hard through primary and that's where I knew Missy. We were actually going through together, Missy Cummings. We went through primary together and then I went to Kingsville. We all selected the same time. I went to Kingsville. There was another guy, Scott Widmaier, the three of us. So I went to Kingsville, Scott went to Beeville and Missy went to Meridian. So the three of us that we had all went through, we got we selected our primary together. We all ended up going jets. And that's that's besides from school. I knew her at school to the long story. I got done, got winged. It took me two years to the day from the time I graduated the Naval Academy until I got my wings and threw some luck. I ended up getting Essex's on the West Coast, which is a side by side bomber. So it's a pilot on the Left Sea and the Bombardier navigators on the right seat. It was built in the 60s. It is all weather and it flies low at night and it's got a terrain mapping radar. How many, I guess, is that a good term to use fighter jet as a broad Category four for the public? Yeah, that's how many fighter jets are side by side like that. That was in the Navy. That was the only one. The Air Force, the F1 11 was a side by side, but the Navy, it was the A6. And then there's the B, which is a derivative of that. And now that those are all gone, the six PS just went away a few years ago and now the Growler is the replacement for the 6B. There was never a replacement for the A6 that I flew really became the fourteen, which the A6 could go quite a bit further distance wise by fuel. Then the Hornet and the Horn as the fighting is there usually two people in the plane, but they're usually like in front and behind in a modern two seater. Yes, but most of the tactical airplanes in the world today are single seat. So he's just one person, one person with the exception of outprice someone to yell at me. But really, with the exception of the Fifteen Strike Eagle and the Fat F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two seater and the G is also a two seater. But it's more of an electronic attack if I say full up fighter bomber. So most of the time that you've flown in, you're like I said, eighteen year career was a two seater. That was about half and half. So I started off an A6 was a two seater. Then I went to a single seat, 15s, and I flew those all the way up until 2000. And let me think, two thousand and one to the end of 2001. And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets. And I flew in both of those the E and the S, but I deployed when I had command of a forty one, I had the two. They were F squadron. So you eventually ended up commanding the the strike fighter squadron. Forty one. I love the the name the Black Aces. What is there some parts of that journey that are amazing parts of it that are tough that kind of stand out to me. It was one, it was a huge honor and I got to serve with you know, I got pulled up because the guy who the the people that are exos because we fleet up, you go from the number two guy to the number one guy. So the XO becomes the CEO, so the executive officer becomes the commanding officer. So I had worked with NOUSE soon to be Vice Admiral. Weitzel was the he was Commander Weitzel at the time was the XO. And he really wanted because he knew there was a little bit of a problem when the Super Hornets came into Lemoore. Limor had been a single seat fighter community since the forever. And now all of a sudden you've got the fat F coming in, which has the weapons systems operators in the back that are not pilots, their weapons systems operators. And there's a difference. And Kenny is a weapons systems operator. And Kenny knew because of my background that I have a switch that I can go one seat to seat, one seat DC, because when you fly to seat, there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload and take the advantage of the weapon systems operator. And it's not that one plus one equals two in that environment because it really there's a huge amount of capabilities that the single seat has and the autonomy that comes for the ability to make decisions quickly and how well the airplane flies. But it does it does equal more than one. And I would say that one plus one with two people as well is a minimum of one point five, because you've got an extra head, you've got extra eyes, you've got someone that can monitor systems. The airplanes can do two things at once. I mean, there's an incredible amount of capability that we add when we do that. Can we just pause on that just for me from like a human factor? And also a I perspective, what's how difficult so there's like when there's two people, there's also a third person that's the I part the some level of automation, like autopilot, maybe. That's correct. Maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of, like you said, making decisions really quick, 80 percent. How do you deal with another brain working with you and then also the automation. Is there an interesting interplay that you get to learn? And also as that change throughout your career, I imagine it got you gotten better in terms of the automation or perhaps not? Well, I can tell you so let's say there's a bunch of stars. There's no this is this is good. This is good. And this is you know, I'm enjoying this because now we actually get to talk about something other than a Tic TAC. So. So let's start with the A6. The A6 was really an analog airplane that was built in the 60s. All right. And there's been studies done on the crew coordination, which is the interaction between the pilot and the Bombardier Navigator. So we would fly low at night in the mountains. So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington. So you've got the Cascades, an incredible amount of time. And we would get in the simulators because unlike normally people think train following and there's the radars, the 111. The B1 has a system like this, put it, the radar can see and it'll fly, basically flies a straight line. So it goes up and over mountains and back down and up and over mountains where the A6 was really manual. So you do this low level routes where you're going to you're going to fly in the mountains at night. You're going to be at, you know, 500 to 1000 feet above the ground ripping through like fog layers because you don't need to see outside you're you're literally forcing a little TV screen radar. What are you looking at most times? Just as a screen? It's this really primitive. If you look at it now, what we did, you think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really fun. So it's similar to like the flare stuff is that is no, this thing is totally radar based. Now, the airplane had a flare ball's target recognition and multisensory was called a tram. You're looking at like basically like dots of hard objects. You know, actually what it is, is the Bombardier navigator had a radar and he was getting a raw feed off of a pulse radar in front. OK, so it's just basically mapping the mountains. So if you look at a mountain on a radar and you're coming up on it, the front side is going to be it's going to give you a really bright return. And on the back side, it's just going to be a giant shadow because you can't see on the other side. So the Bombardier navigators would do that and they would have charts and they could shade their charts knowing that, hey, if we turn a little bit left here, we can get in this valley, we can sneak up this valley and go round the back side of the mountain, which is what the airplane would do. And inside interrupt. I'm going to just keep asking dumb questions I project. But the pilot at a high level say what the pilot does versus the bombardier. So you're a you're actually just controller. I'm flying the jet. I have the throttles, the stick and I have a it's about a probably a four inch or six inch wide by maybe four inches, five inches high. It looks like it's literally a CRT. That's all it is, a CRT screen. And what it would do at the radar would do is the the the Bombardier navigator is looking at his radar and he's looking out about twelve and a half miles in front of the airplane. So he has the range really scope down because a radar can see a lot further. He's looking at about twelve and a half miles when we're in a terrain mode where we're dodging mountains and stuff. And what the pilot has is there's they're called range bends and there's eight of them. So the very far range bin is the twelve and a half mile, you know, and the closest range bin, it's a thing. And it'll be like between like a half a mile and a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile. And the next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles. And then it just keeps going out like that. So if there's a mountain, if for let's say we're on a flat plane and there's a mountain out in the distance at fifteen miles, and we we're just driving right at it. So when we get to the point where it hits twelve and a half miles where the radar is going to see it on his scope, my twelve, my range been for that would pop up and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain. And then as I got closer to it, the next arrangement would pop up and show it and I could see that that bump was moving towards me. And then if I turned a little bit, you know, to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over to the right hand side and I could do that. But it wasn't like a video game. It's literally like if you think of the original Atari's. Yeah, but you build up, I imagine that you start to get a really deep sense of like the actual 3D environment based on that little Atari. It sounds you're exactly right and you have to you have to train. So there's been studies, no matter of fact, a lot of the basis and people argue with me. But it's true. There were studies done watching a cruise in our simulators. We call it the WIST, the weapon systems trainer. Then it was not even emotion. It just kind of sat there and you just you can fly these things and had train that they would inject into the system. But the. Through coordination, so you get so my first my First Fleet Bombardier navigator who who I'll name him, his name is Chris Sadow. He's a works at Apple, pretty high up at MIT Grad, I think computer engineering. He's scary, smart. So Chris could really work. And matter of fact, all the guys I flew. So there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple, who's now at SAP. We did our first night Trappes together. The bond between us. I mean, it's one of those things that you just you're never going to forget. But Chris and I, when we started flying together, we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron. We'd spent a lot of time training. And Chris was amazing at how he could work the system, one, because he was extremely brilliant and he had that inquisitive mind of all. We could do all these different things and there's all these degradation modes. But we spent a lot of time to see how good we could actually get because in it's you almost talk in Parshall's. So as the B.N. is looking at his radar scope, Chris would say, I've got rising terrain. That's just what they say, and rising terrain at 12 miles. And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, got it. This is going to go to your question on the autonomy and how you work with two heads. So when you first get together, the interaction, it's it's almost like you have to rehearse that you have to know and you talk in full sentences the more and more we fly together. Chris could go, I'm showing, and he'd get, like, rising out. And before he finished, I'd say, I've got it. So you end up starting to talk in Parshall's because. I have to trust him. Like, I mean, there can be no I can have no doubt that he knows how to do his job because I'm literally looking at this little scope that's not giving me this continuous picture of that mountain moving. Remember the mountains here? And then it's going to pop up here and then it's going to pop up here because there's gaps in the coverage on how the system was set up. Remember, it's an analog system to where he is telling me, like, I can't see all the way to the left. And he he's got a wider scope on the radar. But my screen doesn't show that. So he's told me, start a left turn, how to avoid a hard turn. And we would do that. So, Mike. And this is all happening quick, very quick. Well, you're doing we would typically fly between four hundred and twenty and 480 knots of ground speed miles an hour. Well, twenty seven miles a minute or eight miles between seven and eight miles a minute is what you're flying at night. I mean, I broke out of clouds. I mean, I remember him and I fly and we were on its ear. It's called an ear out, an instrument route that's low there all around the country. There's either three forty four that we used to fly, which would Kostyan off of. You'd fly from the land. You go out over the ocean, turn around on and you could practice actually coming in on a coastline. And we were flying and we ended up in the clouds. Keep in mind, we're between 500 and a thousand feet in the mountains and we're in the clouds like you can't see anything. And I had to turn off our red lights that flash, you know, they're called a antipollution light because it was reflecting off the clouds. And it starts to bother you. Just gets annoying. So I turned it off and we were flying, we're flying, we're flying, we break out of that coastal marine layer and we break out and it's a decent night. And this is right by Mount St. Helens. This is kind of we're coming in. So we're coming in from the east and we're just north of Mount St. Helens where the route goes and you look up, you know, because you can kind of see the silhouette of this mountain that's right next to you. But you're flying along here just like, you know, you got to trust and you can see houses, you can see the lights, they're above you. We're literally below people's houses flying down these valleys. And so just incredible experience. So when you take that and then you move into an effort. So now we're into modern technology. It was actually built in this century and you're flying. So now, you know, the WIZO is behind us and we're not doing those night low levels, but that same type of crew coordination that has to happen because what you're doing is you're sharing the load. So most of the communications that go out of the airplane, the wizard does all the talk and he's got and actually he uses it with the that's the weapon systems operator in the back of an. So he's going to run. Well, the radar kind of runs itself now, but we have a situational awareness display and it's linked to all the other airports that has to do with the situational awareness display because that term comes up a lot and think of it as think of it as a God's eye view. So if you have the back of the Super Hornet has well, the block tube has about an eight by 10 display for the windows that they can look at. The pilots is smaller. It's down between us. It's a six by six between his legs. And they're they're getting ready to redesign that. Boeing is. But when you look at it, you'd be like if you put your airplane in, you're looking down. So all the stuff like if you're radar seeing bad guys out in front of you be like looking down, going, oh, I'm right here. I know there's bad guys out here and my wingman is over here and it shows everything. It's just like it gives you you can look at that display and go, oh, I can see where everything is at. I can see if one guy's trying to target another guy. It shows you all that. So it's an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up for the crews to maintain the overall picture of what's going on, because big just sense it because it's happening so fast. And this is where that autonomy piece, this is the third brain. So we're all looking at it and the third brain is doing fusion. It's pulling stuff together, going, oh, this is all this guy. This is this guy. This is this guy. It's sending it out through the link. So all the airplanes are talking to each other through this digital network, you know that we don't even see. It just says that airplane says, hey, I'm over here and it tells us and we go, oh, he's right there. And then we can go. He's his airplane says, oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy. And it shows us, oh, he's he's over there and he's looking at this guy. I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake because your eye, you can hear a lot. But when you look down at stuff, it's all you know, you can see the pictures so really quick. The third brain is doing the sensor fusion, the integration of the different sensors and gives you a big picture view. What about the control? Like is there and apologize is if this is a dumb question. But, you know, people use a high level term of autopilot. How much is there? He's a loose term of A.I. How much automation is there, how much is there in helping you control there? The A.I. piece would be more of a control loop because the digital flight controls so the airplane actually they had to make the airplane easier to fly. And when I say easy, it's relative because people go, I could do it because I did it on flight SIM. Real life is a lot different. In Flight SIM, you have no apparent fear of death. You'll do things in a simulator that you would never do in real life. But the the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage. I mean, because you think about it, you've got a radar that's feeding you data, you've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data. All that stuff is hooked to your head because you've got a joint helmond amount of queuing system on that. It basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit so it can tell where your head's at looking. So if I turn my head to the right, the radar will actually look to the right, the targeting flare, we'll look to the right and oh, by the way, the back seat or has a helmet on, too, so he can look to the left and he can do things so depending on what sensor he's controlling. So if he's got control of the targeting pod and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left, but if I have something where I want to lock a guy up, then I don't see that maybe the radar didn't see. But I can get over a now point the radar, you know, get the because it's a it's a phased array radar now. It doesn't really scan. There's there's all kinds of cool stuff that that technology brings, because if you if you went back 30 years and said, hey, or 40 years ago and said, hey, we're going to have this helmet now, you're going to do everything to your head. And I don't mean a mechanical setup, but I mean, literally, you're just going to map magnetic resonance and go, oh, look. And then I can I can literally slu my sensors this fast and then mash a button and transfer, you know, high quality coordinates from a system into a joint. Jaiden, which is the joint direct attack munition. That is the bombs that you see all the time and then let that thing fly. And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes or hey, I got it. We're going to have to menstruate corniness and you bring back the data and then they do all the targeting for it and then they send another group out to get it instead of all that. Now it's that fast. So there's a I mean, we probably don't have enough time to talk about the beautiful fusion of minds that happens when two people are flying, controlling the plane, but at a high level. This is a really interesting question for people who don't know what they're talking about, like me, which is what is the difference between a human being and and a system like what can what is the ceiling of current AI technology for controlling the plane? Like, how much does the human contribute? Is it possible to have automated flight, for example, like what is the hardest part about flying that a human does expertly, that an assistant cannot in warfare situations in in flying fighter jet flying. So I would say. A.I. systems are usually black and white when you write the algorithm for an system, it's it's it's really it's basically you're taking thought and turning it into a giant math problem is really what you're doing. Right? So you've got this logical math problem. Math problems are there's there's there's a line. It says, I can't or I can't. And it's it's a very finite line, you know, but you can go up to the line where a human we all have gray areas where we go, yeah, maybe I'll try it so he can operate within that group. So if you took if you take an airplane and say, and I'll just take a Hornet for a Super Hornet, don't matter any airplane. And you go, here is the flight performance model of the airplane. So if, you know, in an M diagram is the energy. So it basically says the airplane can fly as slow as this. It can go as fast as this. It can pull this many GS force of gravity. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. And then based on the airfoil design and everything else and how it can pull, here's how it's going to fly, you know, because it's really physics based. Well, if you depending on how you write the A.I., but typically A.I., you don't want the airplane to leave controlled flight. Right. You want to maintain it so that it is flying in a controlled envelope where there are times. And you can go back to World War One where people intentionally departed the airplane from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage, which is that's where the human goes. Can I do this? I know it's outside of where I would normally go, but I can do that so you can do some crazy things now, especially since the flight control logic in modern airplanes with digital flight controls, they're extremely forgiving. So you can literally I've done things in Super Hornets that literally, even as a pilot inside the airplane, you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that. Like, it'll flop ends, which defies most logic. And I guess, you know, in a way you could probably program it. But I still think when you get to the edges that may or may not give you an advantage. There are things that a human can will do that I won't. And I don't think we've got to. The point is, how do you how do you map illogical solutions? You know, most A.I. is logical. It's based on some type of premise. When you write the algorithm to control it, there's bounds. Yeah, there's this giant mess. Like you said, the difference between the simulator and real life also gets that, that somehow that there is somehow the fear of death. All of that beautiful mess comes into play that. Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight, like with Sully landing that plane famously versus the simulator, all of those discussions? Is there some? Well, it's very it's very similar to what I was talking about earlier where the sexo one is. When you're flying with a crew, there's standardization. So you gotta remember when Sully flew, when his first Oscar, that's the co-pilot showed up, you know, first time they met. And this happens all the time in the commercial world. You know, there's six, seven thousand pilots at United Airlines. You know, your chance of flying with the same guy all the time, Slim and none were in the Navy. We were screwed. So I had a primary and a secondary wizo that flew with me for four months. Oh, yeah. For like the deployment. So because you use you have to trust all of those things, it increases the capability airplane. It's not to say we can't swap out, but for true effectiveness, especially in very complex missions like forward air controllers or in the air actually controlling ground assets and supporting ground troops. If you're in a high threat area, which is it crazy busy, you have to you have to be melded. When you do that, you have to have trained to do that job. Otherwise you're going to be ineffective. So when you get to the commercial world and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial, there is a standardization. Like we know that at this point I'm going to put the switch. You're going to do that. And everyone, they know their rules, captain, is going to do this for stops. You're going to do this. And they know that when the emergency breaks out. So in Sully's case, when they take the birds and they know they've got a problem, and if you listen to the cockpit recordings of him, the two of them talking, you know, you got to remember they're talking to each other when you hear the full tapes. But they're also talking to the air traffic controllers in the New York area. And it's like we got a bird strike and the first officer already knows, hey, silenced the alarm. They silence the alarm. The first officers pulling out the book, he's going through the procedures while Sully is actually flying the airplane knowing that they've lost their motors. And you got to think his decision process, like they're trying to get him to go into an airport, into New Jersey and he realizes not happening. We're going to put this thing. And he made a decision soon enough so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane, that he was going to put this thing in the Hudson River. And he did it flawlessly. I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck. The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane, you know, and it got fished out of the Hudson. But what is it about those human decisions he had to make? Is that something you put into words or is that just deep down some instinct to develop as a pilot over time? It's when we when you train, you know, in aviation is a self-cleaning oven. So if you make bad decisions, you're and the list is long and distinguished of those who have died by making bad decisions. And so when you look at what he did or the way we train, because the commercial industry and the Navy and the Air Force for all that we have what's called we have emergency procedures that we have to know, like engines on fire. The first three steps, you just have to know what they are, right. So they know the airline. Same type. You know, they go, hey, I know this is they pulled a book out because the airplanes are designed. They're built to have some time. But there's a point where you have to make a decision and you can't second guess it. So when he decided I'm putting this in the Hudson River, he couldn't all of a sudden, halfway through it go, well, maybe I can get over to that airport. He he looked he made a quick assessment. This is that 80 percent solution where you go. These are not you know, it's it's like a multiple choice test when you go, oh, my God, I don't really know the answer, but I know A and D are wrong gone. So the Jersey Airport and going back to LaGuardia gone. Yeah. So what's my next option. Well the Hudson River is there. That's probably looking pretty good. Or what is my other one. Can I get a restart on the the motors. And then if I can get a restart now can I take it someplace else. He had to make really, really fast decisions and then once they as a they go that 80 percent solution you realize. Right, I'm going into the Hudson, there's the 80 percent. Get the book out. Let's see if we can get our store. Because if you listen to tapes are trying to get it started, the closer he gets to the water, the more he's going, I'm ditching the airplane. So the original decision to this is my best option right now. This is where I'm going. And you start eliminating anything that could possibly change the events which they tried to do. And then he gets to that last minute, says, we're going in the water. They change the plan, they secure the airplane. They do exactly what they're do. And he does that basically flawless landing on the on the Hudson. But you got to remember, every it's every six months for commercial. They go back and they do research in the airplane, in the simulator where they train to the airplane being broken. You just lost a motor. You just lost another motor. So they go through this extensive training, you know, and all these and it's you know, we used to refer to it in the Navy as the pain cave. Where you going to get in? Because you know that when you get in for your check ride in a simulator that the airplane is going to break, you're going to lose hydrogen. And it's sometimes are a problem, like, oh, I just lost this hydraulic system, but I'm having an issue on the other motor. Well, if I shut down this motor and I've got a hydraulics because there's two hydraulic systems, one on each motor, Wolf, I've got an issue with the left motor hydraulic system and my right motor is starting to give me indications. Do I want to shut the right motor down? Because that's going to kill my hydraulic system. That's good. And now I'm flying on a good motor with a bad hydraulic system. And without hydraulics, the airplane won't fly. So it's a really there challenging problems that you have to think through in real time. And of course, the weather is never good. It's always dark. It's always crappy. You're going to break out it. Just all this stuff gets piled on top of you. And it's intended to increase the level of stress, because when things happen, like in Sully's case, we like to joke it's going to stem power. You know, we're the functional part of your brain shuts down and you are literally on instinct like an animal. Well, if you've trained so much that that is the instinctive reaction that you're going to have when the main part of your your cognitive abilities start to shut down, you're you're running. That instinct is ingrained so much into you that you know exactly what to do and that's literally how it happens. So there's no how do I put it, fear of death, like in Sally's case. Do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact if his decision is wrong, a lot of people are going to die? You know, I can't speak for him, but I would say there was so much going on in the cockpit in that time, his his mindset was probably I can do this, I'm trained. I'm going to do the procedures. I've practiced this before. I've done these things. And, you know, I'm assuming that in his mindset, because I never thought about when things were really bad. You know, if you're having problems with the airplane that, you know, that I was going to more, you know, and planted into the ground, it was always, you know, maybe it's an ego thing where you think I can do this. And I mean, so you never have you experienced fear during flight like. I mean, one one way, which is all find mentioning Mike Tyson when he talked about like as he's walking up to the ring, he's like he starts out basically in fear and they are worried about how things are going to go. I mean, purely to put into words his fear. But as he gets closer and closer to the ring is the confidence grows and grows until the ego basically takes over. Do you think there's no way anybody could defeat me? So, like, that's that's his experience of overcoming fear. But do you did you experience any kind of thing like that or is that or do you just go to the part of the brain that goes to the training and then you just go to the instinctual 80 percent solution? I wouldn't say I was never afraid. I think that would be I. I couldn't tell you that anyone I know that wasn't afraid at one time. And for most of us, especially Navy carrier pilots, it's just it's usually especially when you're new and you got to go out and it's nighttime and there's no moon and the weather sucks and the decks move, you know, the ship's going up and down because it will scare lover living shit out of you. Can I say that deficit. So it's about landing and take off that. That is if you even if they used to wire people up, they did it during Vietnam. You know, guys go fly missions, you know, when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going on and people were getting shot down a lot. The highest the highest anxiety and heart rates were coming back to land on board an aircraft carrier. How hard is it to land on that? It seems impossible like for for a civilian, I guess, like me, just seems crazy that a human can do that. The problem with night is there's different degrees of night, just like day. I mean, there's the clear full moon night, you know, where it's like, oh, you know, this is not that bad. But you got to remember at night, I think everyone can associate with your driving in your car. And it's just a it's an overcast, dark night and you're on a country road with no sidelights. Most people have a tendency to slow down just by nature of my God, because you what you'll do is you'll drive your headlights because it is so dark, you know, and you can get outside you get outside a city and get up into New Hampshire, especially when the roads are khurvin, you know, and the lines probably aren't that good. It's, you know, now take that and multiply it by like a million because you have no depth perception what you think is fixed. The runway is actually moving up and down and left to right. Yeah. When it's really bad, you can actually see it move. And we have two systems. You know, there was a there's an automatic system that's actually. It stabilizes with the initials on the ship and then there's the illest now civilian pilots will tell you that ISIS is a precision approach, which gives you azimuth and glide slope. You know, you come down, you it's like a plus on the carrier. It's not it's really just a beam that goes out and it's considered a non precision approach. It's not stabilized at all. That and I've been where you can actually watch the needle and the attack and there's all kinds of stuff moving because the base that it's all sitting on is doing this. And ships don't just go up and down. They they do this. So the bomb goes up and down in the tail like you normally see a ship. And then there's so that's pitch and then it has roll. So it's doing this and then it has heaved. So the whole boat is going up and down while pitching and rolling and Yogurtland on that. So and it's I mean, I remember landing as I was with Chris Sayto and Chris and I, we were off the USS Ranger, which is now decommissioned. It's Sinton getting turned into razorblades. We're flying the old A6 and we come in and it was off to San Diego. And it's just ugly night because San Diego always has a marine layer that is about twelve hundred feet lower than at that time. And it was pouring down rain. It was an El Nino year and there's thunderstorms all around is just crazy tonight I've ever seen of San Diego. And I remember landing and your adrenaline is so high that you're shaking. I mean, you literally can't stop. And we had spun around out of the landing area and we parked we call it the six pack. So it's right in front of the island. So if you see an aircraft carrier of the island and the number of the ship on it, we're sitting right in front of that and we're looking at the landing area. So it's like you get front row seats to the concert and and this this becomes in, you know, ugly pass. He ends up catching a one wire, which is the first one you never want to catch the first one, which means you're not really high above the back of the ship when you landed. And it comes in and the exhaust on another six or eight, six actually points kind of down and it blows and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft. That's how hard it's raining. And you literally could not see across. I mean, I could see the front of my airplane, his airplane, and then it was just white because of the water being blown off the deck. And I'm shaking and I like I'll never forget. I looked over at Chris and I said, oh, my God. I go, Hey, dude, man, 10000 foot runway looks really good right now. And I go, and I'm shaking my hands like this. And I said, I'm not even this is I'm not faking this. I know that's literally I cannot stop shaking. I said that scared the shit out of me. Yeah, but but it scares you afterwards. You don't during it, you're not. You don't have time to think about that, you're doing it. You've got to do is kind of the quote from Tom Hanks. And what's that? The girls baseball movie where he goes, There's no crying in baseball. Well, that's our joke. There's no crying in naval aviation. I said you can fly around and cry all you want at night, but, you know, there's only one pilot in those airplanes and you got to land it. So you cry all the tears away, you know, put on your big kid pants and it's time to it's time to, you know, man up and land that land of jet. Sorry for the romantic question, but going back to the kid, that dream to fly. What's it like to fly an airplane, what it looks incredible to me as a human, like a descendent of ape, I sit here on land and look up at you guys. It seems incredible that a human being can do that. You know, people ask, you know, I'll be sit around my friends and are like I as I said, it's the greatest job on the planet. I said, you know, it's an office with a view because you're sitting in a glass office. You you can do you know, it's like roller coasters. You go, oh, it does all these cool stuff. So we take people flying everyone well. And it's like, oh yeah, I like roller coaster. I go, no, take any roller coaster, coolest roller coaster you've ever been on and multiply it by a thousand. I said it's an experience, you know, to put your body under, you know, you know, the Jets rated at seven and a half, but it'll pull up to eight point one before it overstress. It depends on fuel weight. So, I mean, you routinely get up there towards eight GS to be able to do that to your boss. I mean, it takes a toll. Like I can't really turn my head real good anymore and stuff like that. But would I trade it? I mean, it was a childhood dream. I know how many people get to do that, you know, professional. I want to be an NFL, you know, and you end up to the NFL, which is a very small percentage. Well, I want to fly jets and and to fly. You know, at the time when I was flying the Super Hornets that we had in our squadron were brand new, like literally right out of the factory. I'd come off our first Super Hornet cruise. We had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis where they were building my new jets that I was going to get. And I actually signed the inside of one of the wings while they were putting it together. So I'm meeting the people that are putting the jet together that's going to get delivered to me in a couple of months that I'm going to fly. So just I mean, the whole of it is it's yeah, I it's I'll tell you what, when I left when I decided to walk away. Yeah. I told myself I wouldn't, I promised myself that, you know, once you get through your five command you're flying really starts to tag to come down. You know, even if you go and you're an air wing commander, which is we call tag carrier group commander, you're not flying as much as like the normal pilots, nor should you be. I mean, there's young people that are coming up and it's training your relief because that's the next generation. So like currently, I have friends of mine that we served together. Their kids are flying Super Hornets. Right. So to me, that's really neat because I watched them when they were little. And now, you know, one of them who is good friends is and we'll get his last name. But Joey, who lived down the street from us is a top was a Top Gun instructor. And I'm like, Hey, Joey, Joe is the top gun, you know? And I'm like, that's cool. Because, you know, I went there and I knew him. He would come down to my house. And now to see these kids that are because typically military breeds military, you know, because the kids grew up in it. I mean, and I the only reason that my son is not doing it is he's colorblind. So it disqualifies you for being a pilot, being a SEAL because he had talked about doing that. He's an incredible swimmer and he likes doing that stuff and water polo player. But he's you know, both my kids are well, my daughter is a doctor and my son's in his third year. So but there's a I suppose I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover of this incredible experience of flying to the younger generation. So you don't you told yourself you're not going to miss it. You miss it. There are days I do when I hear jets like if I'm around a base or a jet flies over, but I have all the memory so I can look at it and go, it can't go on forever. You know, Tom Brady can't play football. There's going to come a time where he has to stop. He seems to have done it for a long time. But, you know, typically when you look at you go, I had the opportunity. And I think as automation moves on, especially with A.I., that, you know, when will when will the last man fight or rebuild? You know, and that's that big question. You know, we just did have 35. It's over budget. It's seven years late. There's all kinds of issues when we try and do it. And then you look at some of the new stuff that's coming out that the Air Force is working on with smaller, cheaper a charitable platforms that you can go, oh, we can, because if you don't put a man in the box or a person, because there's a lot of incredibly talented women that do this, too. So I'll just say that as a person. So we say, man, and he we mean both men and women, because offline you told me about a lot of incredible women that thought I had. I had three three female actually for one of them didn't fly any more. She actually lives right around here. She she's she ended up going into aircraft maintenance when she couldn't fly anymore. One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly she's one of the most gifted people I've ever met in my life. She is the vice president. Amazon Air. You can see her on TV. Your name, Sarah. Incredible. And then I had a page who ended up taking command. She got out of fighters and went into other platforms and she was a commanding officer. And then the other one is a teaches leadership. And she is all three of them, actually, all four of the women that were direct. I'm home not forgetting. I don't think I'm forgetting someone incredibly, incredibly talented and a great addition to the writing room. So anyone who gets into the, you know, women can't do it. That's all total horse crap. And, you know, we can talk about the original integration and stuff, which was not done well by the military nor the Navy. So women can fly as good as the guys. Yeah, you can't tell if you passed another airplane. You can't tell if there's a man or woman in it. It really comes down to stick and throttle the ability to extrapolate where the vehicle is going to be, where the airplane would be. If you're fighting another one, you have to be able to think fast. Anyone has those characteristics can do it. And then I think most important, besides that, there has to be a desire. Yeah, and I'm not saying that everyone if you took because we used to track. So when I ran, we call it the rag. It's the replacement air group. It's where. So the the Super Hornet training squadron, there's two of there's one on the East Coast, one 06 and there's one on the West Coast, which is VFP one twenty two, one twenty two is the first one. So I ended up going there and I ended up being the operations officer and training officer. OK, so we track the last hundred students. All right, so everyone goes, it's funny to hear students talk because, oh, he's awesome. If you took the hundred, there's three at the top of the list that are just naturally gifted aviators. They're well, well, well above average. It's like the person in a math class that sits down and complex math and they just get it, you know, at the bottom. There's the three at the bottom that are going to struggle and there's a good chance they won't get out. And if they do get out, they're going to have to work really hard to just maintain kind of average. Sometimes it's just the way your mind works. Not everyone is good at everything. If you took the ninety four of them in the middle there within one mean deviation of, you know, it's there, they're all, you know, it's a the bell curve doesn't look real good. It's just a big hump and it comes back down and everyone's right there within one main deviation. And then you have the outliers usually not on the high side because they're going to get through, but the outliers on the low side that don't make it through. So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job, as does the Air Force of screening. So now what they do when I went, you just showed up and you started. Now what you do is you actually go fly Piper Warriors' wing to see. Can you are you adaptable to this? And there's an evaluation that goes through. And then if you hit a certain mark, then you're good to go and then they put you in a primary. It's kind of like a it's like a PreCheck, you know, like the preset the SAT to go, hey, how am I going to do on the SAT? It's it's it's very similar to that, but it's more of a hand skill. Can you adapt? Because although we live in three dimensions, like this table is not you know, we this is you know, this is all has depth with all that where it's really relative to aviation. We are two dimensional, very two dimensional space. So so our perception is actually more limited than than that of an aviator. Very much. And here's why. So we look at let's look at a tall building. Let's look at one World Trade Center in New York, because that's way everyone knows what looks like big tall building. That's what maybe eighteen hundred feet tall. Even the Burj Al Dubai, which is like, what, twenty one hundred feet tall. It's not that big. So a Super Hornet to do what a split s is, which is I'm flying. I'm just going to roll the airplane upside down and then I'm going to do basically a C the letter C, I'm going to go in the top and I'm at the bottom. So and I'm just basically a vertical displacement of the airplane. So I'm going from high. Low. It's very, very tight and it doesn't it about roughly about 2500 feet, give or take a little. So you go that is that is a really tight vertical turn. Yeah. For example, the A6 in order to do that was about nine thousand feet. And we look at a building that's 20 feet high and think that is Paul. Right. All right. So in an aviation sense, when you're starting to do vertical displacement maneuvers going from 35000 feet down to 20 thousand feet in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane because the human brain thinks we really are, we like to be flat. I see. We we think to do so if I'm fighting how you really get an advantage when you're fighting another airplane is to work in the vertical because most people will do like one move in the vertical and then they want to start to flatten out because that's where we're comfortable. Yes. And if you still think in, like, stacks of two layers or no. Or do do you truly start to think in that third dimension, like the rich 3D world of like of fighting, they could do start to actually be able to really experience the 3-D nature you do, because you have to project you're going to be so you have to know the performance of the airplane, knowing that, hey, if I do this maneuver that I am going to go, it's it's kind of like when I when I talk about when we were chasing the Tic-Tac. So the tektites coming up and I'm at about, you know, and I've been doing this for at the time 16 years. So I'm looking and I'm going, hey, I'm here. He's there on the other side, a circle. I'm going to do a vertical display. So I'm going to go like this. I'm going to cut across the circle. And I'm not going to I'm I'm going out in front of him. I'm going over here because I know that by the time I get through this maneuver, that's where he's going to be. And I'm trying to, you know, basically join up on him. But I also had to look at it go, do I have enough altitude to do it? Because what I did was we're here and I do this. I'm going to end up over here and he's going to be above me. And then, you know, I have to get that energy back to get up to him. And when you're doing a max performance, it's a trade. So you have. This is this is really important when you're when you're fighting airplanes and you're really max performing. So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo, he's literally playing with it. He's got a finite amount of energy. He can add some with the motors and stuff. But you're what you're really doing is it's a trade off and you can trade off kinetic energy speed for altitude, which gives you potential energy. The other pieces is I can trade some of that kinetic energy for performance because I know if I do a nice, easy turn, the airplane will make it. And what doesn't bleed energy. But I know if I do a real tight that twenty five hundred foot split s that it's going to cost me energy. So if I enter the split s at two hundred knots and I do it right, I'm going to come out at the bottom at probably two hundred knots. Although I lost 2500 feet of potential energy, I converted that to that to kinetic and that kinetic was transitioned and bled off the wings in order for me to get that high performance turn. And you have to constantly evaluate where you're at and it's your overall energy package so you can have a guy that's behind you that looks like he's going to kill you. But if this jet is at 400 knots in this jet is at 110 knots, this jet's just going to pull away, drive around and kill him in about 30 seconds. All right, it's overall energy package, and that's that you've got to be constantly evaluating where you're at and this is that 80 percent solution. Can I afford to do this or not? Yes or no? And you have literally a split second to make. The most incredible dance of human decision making is just incredible. I know a million people want me to talk about Tic-Tac, and I definitely will. But let me ask one last ridiculous, subjective question. What's the greatest plane ever made in history? You don't get through, like from pure speed, I would say. Seventy one, I think it's an engineering marvel that was actually developed in the 50s by Kelly Johnson, you know, skunkworks for what that was able to do. And when you get into history of it, you know how they actually built the CIA actually made like six companies in order to buy the titanium from Russia to bring it back and build an airplane out of titanium that we would fly over Russia. To me, that is an incredible engineering marvel. I think that like X 15, by the way, this is our I to drop this. Seventy one still holds the the speed record of any plane, as far as I can understand. Yeah. What's funny when you get into it is it's member fast is relative. And when I say that I mean so if you're going 3000 miles an hour, a hundred feet above the ground, you're going three thousand miles an hour through. You know, that's how fast you're going. When you get up to altitude, there's an indicator of speed and there's a, you know, your ground speed. So you're indicated air speed is really how fast the air is going past your airplane. Well, the air is so thin up there, you may only be showing you like three hundred knots, but at three hundred knots you're really doing 2500 miles an hour over the ground. So, you know, like, we would take the airplanes up to 50000 feet when we had to do full the maintenance check flights on them. So when you're doing two hundred and some odd, not sure it's actually slow for the airplane. It's you know, you're getting you know, it's kind of like it's not you know, there's maneuvering speeds, you know, that if I hit a certain speed and a Super Hornet, that I have the full capability, the airfoil. If I'm below that speed, I'm going to stall the airfoil before I get to the maximum G. OK, so when you look at something like that, you go, well, is it really going fast? When you look at it are seventy one that's flying upwards of, you know, 70 plus thousand feet. The air so thin, you know, just like the F-16, you can get to much higher speed. But the relative speed of the air going over you is actually relatively low. So the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be if you were down low, but because you're going fast to get enough air over your prostatic system to show that you're going three hundred knots, you're you're screaming. I mean, the fastest I ever got was I was with the wheel soon to be Vice Admiral White. So we had taken a check flight in and I got it up to one point seven eight. I got a Super Hornet to make one point seven, eight. And it was and we were struck by Pebble Beach two. And it what's that feel like when you get that fast start to me, it got a little bit weird because you realize in your brain and I did that there's no out. If something happens I can't eject the ejection would kill me. It's that kind of liberating in a way that maybe not always want to push the limit. You know, it's like how fast I could have got it going faster. It was it was literally still accelerating when I stopped. But I had it was fuel limited and space limited because I you know, I'm off the coast of California, Big Sur, and I'm going and I can see Pebble Beach out in the distance, you know, the whole Monterey Peninsula just going. And you're doing almost 18 miles a minute. I mean, you're screaming. Yeah, I mean, that's. And then you have to. Well, the airplane didn't have anything on it. It was a slipped off Super Hornet. So it's basically just the airplane. No pylons, no pads, no nothing. And then we had to get it turned around because we got to go to the exit point for the area. And I'm trying to get it down below to subsonic. And there's a bunch of things that are disabled, like the speed brakes that normally we pop out. When you're going that fast, they don't because the Super Hornet really doesn't have speed brakes. It deforms the flight controls. They don't function. So you really you're trying to maneuver. And when you're going that fast, you can't turn because a seven G turn at one point, five mock is a pretty big turn. So it's just it's crazy, incredible that a human can do this and human can engineer that the system, which allows another human to control that system, that it's to me, it's it's I think it's just it's it's one it's a great experience. Was it sad to see this? I saw anyone go. I think it was during your career. I mean, do you guys romanticize the different planes? We would see it flying when I was flying Hornets because we the West Coast flies in. It's called our twenty five away, which is covers the Navy China Lake area and Edwards. That's a huge area. It's it's actually I think the guy from Switzerland come out because they were they had hornets and he's like, this is bigger than our whole country now because it's a pretty big area in California that you fly. But you would see the seventy ones. They had a loop because NASA was flying them out of Palmdale and they would take off and they'd go up towards Washington State and Montana and they do a loop. And so you'd see them coming back down. They descend above sixty thousand. You'd either get contrails, you know, the white lines behind airplanes and come down and hit the tanker and then they go back up. So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying. But, you know, I think with money age, the advent of satellites, you know, because they're everywhere now. I mean, you got commercial companies putting satellites up. How much of that need was really there? Because you got to remember when those things. Started in the 50s, Sputnik wasn't flying around, you know, it was it was the U2 and ESR 71 that were out there doing that work. So at the time it was needed, it was at the if you think about it, really, it was an incredible feat of aviation for that time. Yeah. I mean, literally, we have yet to pass that. And you also ask, what is our need to pass that? I go, I don't know, we got stuff in space. So do we need to make an airplane that goes that fast? I think the next one is you get into the hypersonics where you don't have to put a person in. It does all kinds of crazy stuff, you know, to work with automation, all that kind of stuff. Yeah. So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is you happen to be one of these, in my view, one of the most credible witnesses in history of somebody who's witnessed a UFO literally and identified flying object and not only witnessed, but got to. How do you put it? Like chase it? Essentially, it chased it. So let me just lay out I think it's easier than you telling the story. Maybe me and my dumb simpleton waste trying to explain the story as I understand it, and then maybe you can correct me. So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton, which is one of the carriers, that's cruiser, the cruiser cruiser. So you can't land on a helicopter, has a helicopter pad on the back and has weapons on it. OK, got it. Shoots the missiles up, but has a nice radar, just an incredible spy system, phased array for panels. So it looks at squadrons. Perfect. So they started noticing on November 10th that there is a few objects flying around at twenty eight thousand feet with speed of with what I guess is considered a low speed of 120 miles an hour. Don't know that in knots, but on the coast of California. So and they kept detecting these objects for just about a week, then comes in like you're part of the story, which is on November 14th. From the I guess it's from the USS Nimitz, I you flew and witnessed a 40 foot long white tic tac shaped object with no wings flying in ways you've never thought possible. And in some interviews, some way, he said, I think it was not from this world. So there's a mysterious aspect to this object, to this entire situation. There's videos involved, the video of a flare, forward looking infrared receiver, receiver. There's also the visible light. You can switch TV as a TV mode, so that gives you visible light. And then as I Armont and Chad Underwood recorded that video and those are the videos that were released by the Pentagon later, one of the three videos, the two other videos go far and Gimple were recorded in two thousand something, 14 or 15 here on the east coast of the United States that had different kinds of objects. But they're weird in the same kind of way in terms of at least the videos and the experiences that people have described were similar in in the degree of weirdness. But the difference is, is actually on the East Coast, the 2014 case, very few people have spoken about it. And even in your situation, very few people have spoken about it. So there's a mystery to it. But it's in some sense, it's a quite simple story without much resolution to the mystery. And it's fascinating. And there is a lot of opinions. There's division of opinions because it's a mysterious I mean, it truly is a UFO in the sense that UAP, what is the unidentified phenomena? So can you maybe correct me on any of the things I've gotten wrong, elaborate on some key things and describe that experience in general. So here's what I know. So, yeah, we went out on our mission to go train and they canceled the mission. And they said there's all kinds of rumors out here, there's all kinds of after this has come out, so originally it was the four of us. There's two jets, two people in each jet. They're FAA. OK, there is no video from our event. It was all four sets, eyeballs staring at this thing. And then when we came back and told it when Chad and his pilot took off, that's when Chad got the video of it. And we're like, that's it. That's exactly that's it. And so when you see eyeballs, you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing. Yeah. So so we're flying out. We get we get vector, they come up and tell us, hey, we're going to cancel training. This is the USS Princeton. So this is this Aegis cruiser. So we're talking to one controller. Who is like, hey, sir, first you ask what ordinance we have on board, and I laugh because we don't carry live ordinance and training, typically because bad stuff happens, usually someone forgets to put a switch on and then the missile comes off and hits a good airplane and it's not good. So we had what's called a of nine, which is really just a blue two with the aim night speaker on the front of it, which is an air missile. So there's only two ways to get it off. You can beat it off with a sledgehammer. You can take this thing and you put a wrench in it and unlocks the lugs and pulls the plugs back in. That holding on when it really fires the impulse from the engine actually throws it looks forward and breaks that release and it comes off down the rail. That's how it works. So they said, hey, well, we have real world tasking. So as we're going out, my wingman, the other pilot, she maneuvers airplane to the left hand side of me. So she's kind of stepped up like this. And I'll use your Mike Box to start says we're going out there. Corn ranges are called broccolis bearing range in altitude. And they're telling us, hey, it's at 40 miles or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles. So they're saying a two seven zero thirty twenty thousand. So they say so we got our radars and we had we had mechanically scanned radars at the time. APJ 73, good piece of gear, maybe. Seventy nine new ones way better. But anyway, and I apologize if I interrupt the story, Wolf, it's useful, but they're telling you the location of a thing that you should look at. If they're telling us they have a contact on their radar, they don't know what it is. They just have a blip. They have a little blip. Well, they've been watching these things. And what he told me is they had been looking at these things as we're driving a system. We've been tracking these things for about two weeks. That's we'd been at sea for two weeks because this is the first time we've had planes airborne. We want you to go see what these are. They kind of interrupt the mission to say check it out. So we start driving out there. And as we get down to he's going, you know, 20 miles, 15 miles, ten miles. And then you get to a point where they call merge plot, which means we are inside of the resolution, some of the radar, because radars don't see everything there. So they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution. Right. So and it's basically think of a little cubes so they can and the whole sky is made of all these little cubes and they're looking. So if you're inside a cube with something and you're both inside the same little cube, then the radar can only see one thing that makes sense. So they call merge plot. Well, when we say merge plot to us, it means he's right around. Something's around you get your head out. So we're not looking at radar scopes anymore. And the Wizards, the Wizards can look, but everyone else heads out when they say merge plot. You're done looking at your displays inside. You're doing this and you're trying to find it. So as we look out to the right and you look high and low because he could be anywhere from the surface all the way up, now, keep in mind, the ship is like probably 60 miles away. So it can't see the surface. And you can do your standard radar horizon calculation and go, hey, it's the the thing is 40 feet off the water, the panel can really see, you know, there are radars that can see around the curve. But let's just say that it can't at this time. So, you know, is it worse than that? So as we're looking around, we see know this is a it's a clear day. There's no clouds and there's no whitecaps. It's just a calm. It's actually a perfect day. If you on a sailboat, it was that five to 10 knots a win. And you just want to kind of go out there and you're not going to get beat up and have Whitewater come out, is it was the perfect day to own a sailboat. How many miles? I'll take like seven. Like, you see, just it's a clear day. It's 50. It's unrestricted visibility. You can see literally all the way to horizon. It's just clear it's nothing. And we're basically off the coast. If you look at a map and you go San Diego and inside of Mexico, we're kind of in between that. And we're probably about by the time this all hits, we're price and low. Eighty hundred, I don't know. But somewhere out, it's pretty far off the coast. Perfect is from twenty thousand feet. You'd be amazed. You can do the calculation, you can see stuff, you'll see land fifty miles away. You can see, you know, and when you're looking at a continent, it's really easy to see. You're not looking at an island. I mean, you're looking at Mexico. And you can see on the whitecaps in the water if you if there is any. Oh yeah. They're easy. Yeah. For us, we look at it because we know if it's natural wind or so if it's a really whitecap windy day, then the ships just kind of barely be moving when we land on it. It makes it actually easier if the ship has to move where it's got a big weight because it has to make its own wind when we land, which is the day that it was this day you go, OK, and it creates what's called we call the Birbal. But when the air flows across the flight deck, it drops behind the ship, you know, and then it kicks back up. So when you're coming board to land, it's going to make you go up a little bit and then you're going to fall and you got to you got to anticipate that to stand glide slope. So we're pretty we're pretty conscious of what's going on out there with the waves in the wind. So we there's no waves. There's no wind. There's no white caps. And we look down and we see white water. So if you put if you put a piece of land, a sea mount below the surface, like, you know, even 20 feet below the surface, it's big enough. As the waves come in, waves have height and length when they come in. That's what happens on the shore. When a wave comes in, it hits and then it starts to collapse and it pushes the wave heights up because it can't go any more and then spin it. And that's where you get the white. So what happens is at sea when you get a storm out, you'll see stuff come in, the wave will crash and you'll get white water. You can go out when it's high tide and any one of the coast, you can go out here off of Boston and go, hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks in at high tide. I can't see the rocks are covered, but there will be white water around those rocks. You'll be able to tell there's something underneath the surface that makes sense. Yeah, so that's what it was. We see we don't see an object because there's all kinds of. Oh, they saw this, they saw it. Another craft below the way. We didn't see anything below the water. We just saw white water. But the white water and I like to shape it. You can say it was a cross. I say it's about the size of a 737. So it looks like if you took a 737, put it about 15, 20 feet below the water. So the waves breaking over the top and you're going to get white water where the plane is that you'd see that this kind of shape. So it looks like a cross. So we're looking down off the right side, the back seat or any other airplane. Jim says this is that talking and partials again. He says, hey, skipper, do you? And that's about what he gets out of his mouth. And I go, what the hell is that in? Do you see? That essentially is what we see, the white water, and that's what draws our eyes down. Otherwise we'd never seen it. So we see this. I would love to see the look on your face when you see that. And then we see this little white Tic-Tac because we're about twenty thousand feet above it and it's doing it's going basically north, south and then east, west, north. And it's abrupt. It's very abrupt. So it's not like a helicopter for helicopters going sideways and it goes once it's going sideways. Lt goes what it'll do is it'll go, it's got to speed. It slows down because there's inertia and it stops and then it goes back the other way. This thing's not it's like left, right, left, right with no so moving in ways that doesn't doesn't feel intuitive to you at all of the things you've seen in the past. So as a pilot, the first thing you think is it's a helicopter. Right. So you go, oh, what is? Because we see it's moving. We're like, oh, helicopter. So the first thing you look for to see if it's a helicopter when they're doing that, because usually when they get down there towards that fifty feet, you'll get rotor wash. You see it in the movies when the helicopters by the water water comes up the sides because the downdraft, you know, like a thunderstorm will do that. It pushes the air down and then it has to come up the side. So you see it and you go, well, there's no there's no rotor wash. What does that thing? So by this time, we're driving around. So as we're if we were at the six o'clock, we're driving around towards that nine o'clock position and we're just watching this thing. And it's just it's still pointed north, south and it's going left, right. And it's kind of moving around the object. And if it had if I had to say it biased itself, it was biased towards the bottom half. So if you've got the east west and then the north south kind of. Cross, it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out, just kind of moving up, down, left, and it's crossing over it, it's going up kind of. So now we're like, what the hell is that? So then I go, hey, I'm going to go check it out. And the other pilot says, I'm going to stay up here. And I said, yes, stay up high, because now we get we get a different perspective. So she's up here and I'm down here as I'm descending. She can watch because right now all I'm watching is the Tic-Tac. She can watch me and the Tic-Tac. So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on, which is really important. You can hear people say it's high cover, whatever. She's watching me, which is it's perfect as the story goes on, because it gives a two perspectives of perspective. It's about eight thousand feet above us when that thing disappears and they don't know because of it, just like, oh, I lost it. They go, no, it's over to the right. We can still see it. We all lost it at the same time. So as we come down, we get to about 12 o'clock and I'm just descending you. It's an easy descent. I'm doing about three hundred knots, which is a really good air speed for the airplane for maneuvering, because I have I have everything available to me at that speed. So I'm coming down and as I get to 12 o'clock as it takes doing this, it literally it's like it's aware of us and it just goes and it kind of points out towards the west and starts coming up. So now it's obviously knows that we're there, whatever this thing is. And I was over there. So as we drive around, it's coming up and I'm just coming down. We're just I'm just watching it now. You remember, this whole thing is like this is like five minutes. This is not like we saw it. It was gone. Or I saw lights in the sky and they were gone. We watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers. Watch this thing fly around. So we're like, OK, so I get over to the eight o'clock position and I'm a little I'm a couple of thousand feet above it. And it's about so I'm probably about 15 k I think it is. I think as my stories about fighting, it's just estimating. So you can see it's really easy to say because so was fourteen, fifteen thousand feet. I thought it was eight thousand dollar. The other airplanes up about that. OK, so they're still at about twenty thousand feet so they're in the air slowly and I'm descending, they're staying up there. So I'm kind of doing this as I drive around. OK, so I'm looking at this thing and it's about the two o'clock position. We're about the eight o'clock position. And I'm like, oh, I've got I've got enough altitudes. I'm going to I'm going to cut across the circle. I tell the guy in my back seat that I'm going to want to do this. He's like, go for it, Skip, because I was the skipper, so I cut across the bottom. So I'm kind of almost coming out co altitude as this thing's coming, I'm going to meet it and I'm driving and I get to probably it's I'm probably about a half mile away, which you think, well, half mile is pretty far half mile in aviation isn't. It's nothing that's I mean you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane. You can see all kinds of stuff at a half mile. You can see pretty good detail. So I'm like right there and it's coming across my nose. So now I'm basically pointing back towards me. So I'm cutting across because I'm going to the three o'clock position. It's at two o'clock and I'm going to meet it at three o'clock because I do this. It goes it just accelerates and disappears. So this happens at around estimate, about 12000 feet. So they're at twenty. So they've got about 8000 foot of altitude above us when this happens. And it just is it crosses our nose. It just it accelerates. And literally in less than less than a half second, it just goes and it's gone. And so we're like and the first thing is, dude, do you guys see it? The other airplanes like it's gone. We don't we have no idea what's that. So we kind of spin around. OK, well, let's see what's down here. And I turn around. We're looking for the white water. We can't the whitewater's gone. There's nothing. It's literally all blue. So now you go. And I remember telling the guy in my back seat I could do them. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty weirded out because this is I mean, you know, at the time, like thirty some hundred hours of flying. I've been doing it for 18 years. It's nothing like anything, you know. So as we turn, we go, oh, well, let's just go back, you know, because now I've got to put on my real hat, which we have to train because we're getting ready to deploy to overseas. So we got to get our training done. So that's my mindset, especially as a CEO, because, like, I get I get it training out of the flight time because I'm responsible to do that. So, hey, let's go back. And the the guy who's going to be the bad guys is the CEO of the Marine Squadron. And so Cheek's is that, you know, he's listening to all this happen, you know, because he's just like because he when he first went out, they were going to do him. But the little Hornets, the legacy hornets, that cities don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets. So he had launched first and they were going to do him. And then they knew we were off the deck. They just told him, hey, go to your cap point down south and we're going to send we'll pass this off to the Super Hornets with a cap point, because that's where we hold. So it's called a combat air patrol point. So we're just going to hold at one end. He's going to hold at the other end. It's kind of like, hey, you guys are going to think of it. If it's a football field, we're going to sit on one goal line. He's going to sit on the other goal line. And when they say go, we're going to run at each other and try and do something in the middle of a field, then go back to our reset points. OK, so you're talking to him. He's he's he's listening to the he's just listening. We don't talk to him at all. He's just he just dials up because they know that we all know the frequency. So he's listening to what's going on because he's like because I cancel training. So what else is he going to do? He's just going to hang out there and do circles while he's waiting for him and his. Winchman, so they're just there listening to all this go on and then at this point you move on? Yeah, we come back up to train, we go back as we're flying back the controller because we're talking to the the kid on the Princeton, the the they're called OSes are operation specialists. They're the ones that run the radars. And we're talking to him and he's like, hey, sir, you're not going to believe this. But that thing is that your cap, it showed back up. Just popped up. You know, this is like 60 miles away. It just reappears. We're like, oh, OK. So we got the radars that we're looking for it. We get out there. We never see it. We never see it again. We do what we need to do. We come back to the ship. Of course, now we're like, oh, this is going to be where I told I told him, I go, do you know we're going to catch we're going to get shit for this. When we get back to the ship, we're going to get out and we're just going to catch maximum. And we did. And it's kind of joking, you know. So the ship plays, movies. We have movies on the boat and they do twelve hours of movies. So they repeat because there's a date check and a night check. So the same movies in the morning and night place. So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie on the boat, which drives my wife crazy because I watch stuff on TV. That way too will be like, oh hey, I've seen this and I'll jump into a movie in the middle and then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning and I'll put it all together because that's how we have to do it, because we're so busy. Well, the movies became and is Men and Black Aliens. Independence Day definitely going to catch some shit. Well, we will. But let me just ask some dumb questions just because it's whatever whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened, it's, you know, one of the most fascinating things, events in recent history. So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about a different kinds of angles. There's no good answers, but it's interesting to ask some dumb questions here. So, first of all, you mentioned you saw at some point X, Y, and then somebody in the Princeton said you're not going to believe this or it's that cap point that's a different place. How the heck did it know what your point is? That's a good question. That's one of you to know one. You know, you don't you don't tell it. We don't broadcast it. We have a waypoint in the system. But I don't know if maybe it knew where we were going because we used the same one day after day after day. But it it obviously knew. And you never saw it there. Never saw it there. Chad, when he took off, when he got the video, we landed, we told them, hey, look, we just we just chased this thing. They're I go in there like Wigo duty and I go and I told him, I said, did get videoed. He goes, so and that's how he is. He's like, oh, I'm going to go. Anyway, he was he was determined he was going to find this thing, so. When you look at his video and this is the stuff it is now that they don't see because not all the all you see is the fleer tape, that's the targeting pod, the forward looking infrared receiver. I'll probably overlay the visual when he people when he goes out, it's, you know, what he's looking at on his displays as he has basically two radar displays up. He has azimuth and range on the right one and he has azimuth and elevation on the left one. So this is called the Asil display. And this is called this is basically the PPE, which is the you're at the bottom of it. You're at the bottom of the square. It's really taken this it's taken a cone because a radar really looks left and right from a point and it squares it out. So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us, because they do this, they squared off. So so he goes out and when he first sees it, he gets a radar return on it, because when he's not trying to lock it, so the radar just throw an energy out and get it. You know, it's a Doppler radar. So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing. It's going, oh, I can see. I can see. And it's looking for a turn. So he gets a return. So he wants to see what it is because all you get is a little green square unless it builds a track file on it. But a little green square is just sitting there. It's not moving because it's it's sitting in one spot in space. He locks it up when he goes to lock it up. Now, he's put in a bunch of energy on it. So he's telling the radar, stare down that line of sight and whatever's there. I want you to grab it and build a track file on it, which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is and the direction that it's going. OK. The radar smart enough that when the signal comes back, if it's been messed with, it will tell you, it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed. So that's all it is, is you send the signal out something, it manipulates the signal either in range and velocity or whatever, and it sends it back. And the radar was smart enough to go. That is not a return that I'm expecting. Something's messing with me. I'm being jammed and it shows you and it puts strobes up. It gives these lines on the radar and it does some stuff. So you can I mean it. Well, it does. It goes full into it. It's being jammed at about every mode you can possibly see because everything comes up and the the this aspect gets long and all kinds. I want to get into details, but you can tell it's being jammed. So and as you said, a program, by the way, the jamming is an act of war. Active jamming is when you actively jamming on a platform. Yes. It's technically an act of war. Feels like you should be freaking out at this point. I mean, so. Well, he does it and then in the back seat, so they don't have a stick and throttle. They have their side stick controller so they can control all the sensors and they can just toddle around and do stuff. So he can he has the ability to just move one switch real quick and it will go from that Azmath elevation on the radar to the targeting pod. Well, as soon as he command of the radar to look at that target, the targeting pod goes, oh, what's over there? And it'll stay there because it goes down the line of sight because all the systems are hooked together. You can decouple them, but they're going to automatically couple up. So when he cassells over a switch looks like a castle, which was a castle. So when he moves that thing to the left and he swaps the displays out and he says, instead of looking at the radar, I want a look at the targeting pod he sees in on the targeting pockets, targeting pods already looking there. And now he's on a passive track because he's not literally sending any energy out. He's just receiving our energy from the Tic-Tac. And then the system itself will track the pixels. And the contrast of this depends on what Modred. So it says, oh, and that's what those little bars you see in the video where the Barsh left some vision based tracking. That's exactly what it is. So that's the video he goes through, Zoom's changes, the money. He goes through all the modes. So there's a narrow, medium and wide. So wide is far away, medium and then narrow. And then there's the TV mode and he goes from our mode to the TV mode. That cool thing with the TV mode is narrow air mode is only medium TV mode, so you can actually get closer with narrative mode. It's got a better zoom capability when you go on a TV mode. So he goes through all those things and that's when you see it going from a black background to white back, trying to figure out what the heck is this? Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data as he can on it based on the different modes instead of just staring at it with that thing. Green the so the video has been out. It actually was on YouTube for years and before the government released, it leaked two thousand. What about. No, I got the guy that was in my back seat, sent me an email and I had retired. So this is about NOCH because I was working I was working down in San Diego. So this is about two thousand eight early. Two thousand nine. So sends methanol to strange land dotcom, which is not suitable for workboats top notch. Yeah. And he says, hey, I can remember the email. Hey, Skip, does this look familiar? And I look at I'm like, how the hell did that get on strange land? So the next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube, which was cool because you can send a YouTube link to someone. You don't send strange land dotcom to someone because you don't know what you're going to get. It's like Googling kittens. Yeah. So it ends up there somehow. So it gets on YouTube, which is cool because I would go out with my friends and we'd be drinking and they do. What's the coolest thing you ever saw flying? You know, it's kind of like you were asking what it's like and I go, oh, did I chase the UFO? And I'm like, get out. And I'm like, No, sir. So this is literally how it happened. So I sit with my friend Matt. So Matt and I did our my he was the guy in my right seat of the eight six when I did my very first night trap. Right. And we were friends to this day. Right. Because when you do stuff like people like that, you know, you had to have faith in him. He had faith in me. You know, there they become like your brother. Yeah. And these are guys that literally, you know, I don't talk to them on a regular basis, like Chris, who works at Apple. If if Chris called me up tomorrow and said, dude, I need help, I need this, I'd be like, all right, let's figure this out. Let's do it. Because it's they're like family. You do it. And most Navy guys, we don't we're not we don't send letters to each other weekly. You know, I have friends that I haven't talked to in ten years that they showed up on my door, you know, pop bottle of wine, grab a beer, drive through the shit, take about first ten minutes to catch up. And it's it's like old times and it's amazing how fast it's happened. So so I'm out to dinner with Matt and I'm telling him this story and he's like, get out of here. So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco, Paco has a fighter sweep dotcom. It's a blogsite. So Paco's obsessed like he is way into UFOs. Yeah. So Pacho calls me up. He says, Dude, I was talking to Matty. That's what we call him. He goes, I was talking to Matty. He goes, did you got to tell me the story? So I'm like, all right. So I spend a chunk of time. And so he calls me one day and I'm like, You're going to voicemail. Hey, give me a call. So I call him up and he answers the phone. But I could hear people in the background and I go, Hey, dude, what's going on? Hang on, hang on. I got to put you on speakerphone. I go, what do you put me on? Because you got to tell a story. I'm having a dinner party. You got to tell the story. So he's literally having a dinner party with his cell phone in the middle of the table as I tell a story. Yeah. So he calls me up again. He says, hey, I got this blog and he just writes about fight or stuff like he wrote about that. We call the shit hot break. That's the guy that when you land on a carrier comes and turns and gets ready to land really fast, like breaks it off right at the back of the ship. And one of the guys when we were junior officers on the USS Ranger, one of the apartments in our squadron is a guy nasty and nasty, was notorious for coming in in a tomcat and crankin off to shit. Hot break. Right. So he he literally wrote a thing about the shit hot break with nasty. And there's another guy or Marv was our one of our landing signal officers for the airwing. It's just it's just it's a good article on how this was and how, you know, it. It kind of forms you in naval aviation. It's kind of become a part of the club. So he said, I got to write about this thing. I like what he does. I got to write about it. Go all right. I go because at first I would say now I'm like, dude, I don't want this out there. Just so you haven't really before then talked about it much because my wife didn't even really know the whole story. What the a comment. Is it just because you caught them? No, it's just I'll tell you what, three days we had the incident for about two days. They played the goofy movies. There's a comic on the back of the airwing schedule that they would put. It was like first one was a Pharcyde in the second one was me and the guy in my back seat. And it was men in black. But it had our names, you know, protecting me, protecting the Nemitz Battlegroup type stuff is just funny shit like that. So so that to me it wasn't that big of a deal. I was like, OK, we're never going to know what it was. I want to get out because this is important because there's all kinds of rumors. There's a group of folks are. No one ever came out in suits to talk to us. Nobody looking like me, you know, came out on a no no one came out of the helicopter, no one came out on an airplane. You know, you get oh, I was told to turn over this classified. What's funny is all the CEOs and several more are still in the Navy. There's one that is a he. I think he just finished up. He was a captain of an aircraft carrier, you know, so he'll end up making admiral and all that stuff. Those guys are my friends. I talk to them daily. Just just to clarify. So just for people who don't know, there's a story that both on the Nimitz and the Princeton folks in a helicopter landed. They showed up, they took the data, quote unquote. So all the sort of recordings associated with this incident and they took it and presumably deleted it. There's a kind of story to that. And then from what I've seen, you said that you believe, just like we were talking about offline, that joke spread faster than or just rumors spread fast and anything. And on the ships that it might have been a joke that started and. Well, they did. So here's the here's the joke. Yeah. So they had come down, right? We had the tapes and they were Chadds tapes. So we use those tapes over and over again. You know, they're they're a consumable remember, I have a budget as a squadron. We have a budget. So I have to buy those tapes. I have to all that stuff that we used, I'm accountable for. And the tapes are actually classified secret because of the data that's on them. OK, so we had the tapes. So the the secured the intelligence guys, the intel officers came down from what's called Civic Cevik, which is Carrier Intel Center, came down and said, hey, we need to tapes. These guys are going to come, they're going to come and get them. This is so we're like I'm like, oh, or whatever, you know? So we hand them the tapes and then someone because I have, you know, people shortly after they came and got the tapes, someone came to me and said, you know, they're they're messing with you. They're playing a joke. So I said, oh, well, let's see how well that goes, because, you know, I'm I'm a CEO and they're not. And so I went down to Civic and it was a private he was a lieutenant or a lieutenant J.G. So he's way junior to me. And I said, hey, I want my tapes back. And he looks at me and I go, I know you guys are pulling my leg. I know you. There's no one came out. And I go and you have about thirty seconds to get me my tapes before I start tearing this place apart. That's when I told him and I said, and if your boss has an issue, he can come and see me because it's not going to go well, I said because it's bullshit and I need those tapes. And he literally walked right over to a filing cabinet, opened it up. They weren't to say if he open up a filing cabinet, pulled him out, handed to me. I said and I basically said a few things to him, like, don't ever get me again. And I left. I had the tapes. So this no one came out. There's no flying going on when all this is happening. And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes. So I took two brand new A.I.M. tapes and I copied the sections that I want. So there's a rumor to that, oh, the original Fleer video is ten minutes long. And there's some one of these petty officers are saying, I saw it. That's total crap. The original video is about a minute, 30 seconds long. What you see on the released video is the entire video. So you have mentioned I apologize if I say stupid things. Please correct me if you have mentioned that, like, I'm not going. I think that you watched it on, you know, on a bigger screen and felt like it was higher definition. So let me ask the the question, is there a higher definition version, do you think, of the fleer video that would give us more pixels and more information, presumably because of the. I would doubt it, because I don't know where the stuff that the government released. I don't know where they got. OK, so the stuff that was on Strange Land and YouTube, you know, someone pulled off of a secret. It looks like Iraq. You know, there's tape machines in there and it gets converted to digital and stored on a hard drive. And they pulled it off that hard drive and they put it on YouTube. Now, it's just like, you know, any time even a digital media, the more you copy digital media, there's some quality that gets it degrades. So you don't know how many times it's been copied. So we were looking at the videos. I've seen her right off the original. They're high eight tapes. That's basically pulled off the back of the display. So it's not film with cameras. It's literally a digital feed. It's pulled off the back and put onto a highway tape. That's how the recorders work. Now, it's actually digital, the digital. It's not even on tapes anymore. It's it's a digital recording system. But we are still in that process of slowly because originally we had little cameras here that shine. So if the light hit, it would wash out the displays. So this is it's a pretty good feed when you put it on. So we're instead of looking at it on your tiny little computer monitor, whatever, I'm looking at it on a nineteen inch because it was still normal TVs back there. We just put flat screens in Iridium that I had bought so we could watch movies. So because when this huge 19 inch screen is maybe 20 Jarndyce, wow, that's huge, gigantic, I can get for like 50 bucks like this since 2005. So so you look at it this big thing and you could see. So when you get to the TV, when I say there's little things coming out of the bottom of it, you could see those. It was very clear. But in terms of the actual visual on the Tic-Tac, was it did you get much more information from the higher from the clear little things out of the bottom at the bottom? So when you see it, because he's coming almost co altitude with it, you can see the bottom of it. It looks like little. You know, like if you look at a Cessna, there's a little antennas hanging out about them, kind of like that. There was two little things on the bottom. There's nothing on the top. There was no plume, no air, no no visible propulsion, even heat signature. You know, it's all that stuff. And then the other thing that people didn't see is they didn't see the radar display, which that really raises a classification level, especially to see what the radar does, what is being in, you know, matter of fact, when they did the unofficial official investigation and about 2000. And let me think about 2009. I got a call, my cell phone from a guy who government employee and said, hey, tell me who he was. He still in the government? I'm friends with him. And he said, hey, we're going to investigate your Tic-Tac thing. This is literally five years later. Yeah, five years later. And I said, OK, whatever. And he did a pretty good job. I call it the unofficial official report because. It was really never official, it wasn't, but I'll give you the history of why I say that and why it never came out in FOIA requests. So he does the report. He sent me the report and all he said is, hey, I'm going to send this report. Please don't distribute this report. I said, OK, the report is now out because Harry Reid got it to George Knapp and they were good enough to redact. There's a few versions of it unredacted. And I'm very protective of the other people that were involved in this. So Jim has talked, but he's off the grid. He doesn't talk to anyone. Now, the pilot of his airplane, she has come out on unidentified, but they don't release her name, although people are starting to do it. And she's had weird shit happen around her house. She's got kids, you know, so I'm very protective of her. And I've told people like Jeremy and George, if I know that it names never came from you, I will never talk to you again about this. And Jeremy's been really good about it. And so is George. And then but George George knew the names were because he had he got the report from Senator Reid. And then the other crew, so the pilot of the airplane that took the video that Chad was in, if you talk to that individual, they really don't have the recollection they were just out flying that day and it wasn't a big deal. So it's you need to protect because not everyone wants people knocking. I don't want people knocking on my door. And, you know, and there's rumors. Are you talk to everyone. I think you're about the twenty third person that I've talked to Total. And that includes, you know, the newspapers and stuff. And I've been selected because there's so much I mean, if I turn down like I turned on Russian TV, I can give you her name when we're done here. She called she not only called me, she called my wife. She called my daughter. She called my son. Did you call my son away? Because they're persistent. So I'm pretty. I'm very particular. I mean, the reason I'm talking to you is because I knew we would have a conversation. It wasn't based just on the Tic-Tac and the Internet, but we can actually talk about some of the science and some of the theoretical to get into to get more people involved to go, because I think there's you know, and when you talk to, you know, Lou Elizondo or Chris Mellon, you know, the group at TSA, you know, that whole thing. That's to the Stars Academy. That's the Tom DeLay group that got started. So you go, well, you know, because I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this, but he's actually when you talk to him, he's he's he's very smart. And I ask him, how'd you get into this? And he goes, oh, when I was traveling around with Blink 182, he goes, you read a lot of books when you're laying in a van and you're driving to your next gig before you make it big. And he goes and he read he was reading books and he read one of them on UFOs. I'm trying to get the title. It's one of the big ones that's out there real popular. And so he started just he started asking more. And through his fame with Blink 182 in the band, he got more and more connected. You know, if you talk to Chris Mellen, who is an undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and he's part of the Melen, you know, Dynasty, you know, from Carnegie Mellon type, very, very smart. He knows he he he definitely knows how the government works because he worked there. And so when I went down to D.C. to talk to people, he's one of the first people I'll go to. When I did Tucker Carlson about a month ago, a month and a half ago, I asked I he text me, I text him Tom Lou to go, hey, because they were like, you got to do it. Because I turned to I'd turn Tucker down a couple of times before and his his producer had called me and I'm like, all right, I'll do it. Because those guys like, you got it. You got to do this for us. So from my perspective, just to give you some context, so to me, there seems to be some stigma. So I come from the scientific community and I really appreciate you talking to me today. And I think that people who listen to this include, you know, of faculty, fellow faculty at MIT and major universities. And it feels like there's some stigma to this subject from from the scientific community. A lot of people, especially when they hear your story, are like, wow, this is really interesting. But you you don't even know when you're afraid to talk about it. And two, you don't know what the next steps are like. How can we seriously try to think about what you saw, how to think about how we further look for things like it, how we develop systems and plans for how in the future we can immediately collect a lot more data and try to react properly, you know, to try to communicate, try to interpret this in the best way possible from the scientific perspective. And I, I just would love to remove stigma from this subject. Well, I think that's the first step we have done in this country, an absolutely terrible job with these things. So you go and I joke, you know, go back to Roswell. So the first reports that came out of Roswell was we have this crash flying saucer. That's literally what came out. And then magically the next day, it's a weather balloon and they're showing your pieces of Mylar and you go, wow, that doesn't look like what they showed us yesterday. Then you get into Project Blue Book, you know, so there's that whole series about Project Blue Book. But The Bottom Line, a project blue book is it really did two things. It investigated sightings. And I did everything it could to debunk and disprove. To the point where it actually went to discredit, you know, to make you look so there's always been this this unlove, you call it an aura around it or a mystique about UFOs. If you're talking about them, they're nuts with ours because I'm not a I'm not a you I'm not a UFO guy. I'm not a junkie. If you ask me, do I believe that there's life outside of Earth, I would say you probably have a better chance of winning the mega ball lottery than were the only planet that has life on it in the universe. It just the odds are against it. If you're if you do just do the math you have to accept, because if there only has to be one other planet that has life on it and then I win and you lose, and the more and more science has shown that there's habitable planets out there, that, yeah, everything we've learned so far, we know very little. But everything we've learned so far about the planets out there, exoplanets, Earth like planets, it seems that it's very likely that there's a life out there. Intelligent life is another topic. But life, well, we we as humans, you know, and even more as Americans, we have this hubris about us that says we are an ego and not so much. Maybe we are not so intelligent because we are. It's just how we learn. So, you know, our main mode of transportation and what people figured out years ago was the internal combustion engine, which led us to jet engines and solid rocket fuel. What if you're in another planet where you didn't you figured out the ability to create a gravity field or you used, you know, because electromagnetics are becoming bigger and bigger and bigger. You know, catapults on ships were steam powered. And the new Gerald Ford is electromagnetic roller used to use the chain to get you the top of the hill. Niyi They shoot you with electromagnetics and you're going. So there's a whole new realm of propulsion that, you know, sometimes it's our ability to develop the technology to support theory. You know, we are just now proving, you know, recently theories that Einstein had were people actually joked about him. And now we actually have the technology to prove that gravity can bend light. You know, we've proven that. So when you look at that, when you go, well, does that mean that, you know, seven years ago Einstein was wrong or 80 years ago Einstein was wrong? Or do you go? We just didn't have the ability to look that deep into space, to actually find something that we could to actually measure. And, you know, and I've seen and that's just a hundred years and that kind of things that can happen if you say, look what we've done in the last twenty years, that's crazy. I mean, because it's such an interesting topic from a career perspective, from a science perspective, you're I mean, you've spoke you've been brave in, you know, telling your story. Not some dramatic thing, but just telling you the things you've seen. Did it encounter did it impact your career? Is that why more people haven't come out like you've mentioned, Roswell? Like how what advice do you give to people, to the community, to me as a scientist, for ways to go forward about this topic and still have, you know, not being put in the bin in society that he's a loon or she's a loon or that person is to get away from the little green men just divorced the two little green men. And, you know, and I've talked to Lou Elizardo about this, you know, and the group that they're working with, which is incredible. I mean, they've got Steve Justice, who used to run Skunkworks, where they built, you know, projects. Now, Lozado, as you mentioned, was a program director. He ran a program at the Pentagon. And Ative was a program that was tasked with investigating any kind of UFOs. So what's funny is the unofficial official report that I joke about, the guy who wrote the unofficial official report was actually an original member of a tip. And the original stuff that ATIP did was for you exempt. And people were, how do you know that I go? Because I stood there with the memo in my hand that said these are literally watch the DOD memo that said it and it was signed. So he was one. So that's why that's why I call it the unofficial official report. It was never there was never releasable because people go I put in a FOIA request and I didn't get that. I go, well, just because you put in for requesting it, I go because how much how much time do you think that guy is going to spend to get you the information you requested if he can't find it? I actually got called by the Navy. I had a commander in a Navy call me about right before the article came out in The New York Times. It was this was starting to come back. And she had called me because there's been there was a FOIA request for stuff about the Nimitz incident. And I said, do you know of anything? She called me because do you know of anything else besides the situation reports that come off the ship? You know, and you got to remember when the situation report comes off the ship, that's like third hand. So we tell someone, they tell someone, that person has to write it up. So there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it. But then there's the unofficial official report that's actually pretty well written, there's some errors in it, but it was you know, I didn't help write it, I just did. And he did a really good job of researching it and figuring out who's who in the zoo and the players. So she called me and said, is there anything out there? And I said officially out there, she said, yes. I said, I don't know anything. I knew of the unofficial official report, which is that one. But I'm not you know, if you don't know about it, I'm not going to tell you because it's not my job and nor do I care. I mean, I did in that whole situation you mentioned, Lou. And did you think about your impact, your career? Just to get back to the question, do you think others, other pilots, other things, other people like in the Roosevelt, are thinking about this kind of thing? Why aren't they talking about this? Why people are afraid to talk about this? Well, honestly, the military in the press, there's a distrust. I'll just tell you that right now we typically don't like talking to the press, because if I talk to you, you know, especially when I do even the TV shows, you know, because I've been on a couple of shows, when you look at it, you know, they come to my house and they film me for two hours. Yeah. And then the screen is five minutes. Well, and the and the other thing with the press, let me give you my perspective from autonomous vehicles is the clipping happens. Yes. But also the incompetence. Let me just call out journalism. They're not thinking. I mean, so here's the thing. I've I have a Ph.D. and I've taken painfully too many classes from like physics and math. And I also have a deep curiosity about the world. I read a lot that seems to be missing with journals. And so you're talking to a person who is not going to push the story forward in an interesting way, not the story, but the actual investigation of perhaps one of the most amazing things that humans have witnessed in history. Like you, it might have been nothing. And who knows what you witnessed might have been from a sort of debunking perspective, might have been some kind of trick of mind if you and others have hallucinated something, that could be some simple explanation, but possibly it was something not of this world. And to not do justice to this story from a scientific perspective, it seems at best negligence. And so, yeah, that's true for a journalist. That's true for the psyche. It's just a it's human nature. Yeah. If we if we can't if we see something that we can't explain. Then sometimes if you just do it, maybe it's just me and you let it go away and you don't think about it. Maybe it'll just, you know, it's it's you ignore it. The other side is the inquisitive mind says, well, what was that? And I want to I want to dig more into it, you know? And if you you you look at it or you going against the norm, you can get ostracized, you know, and if you look at, you know, Einstein is the perfect example. I mean, he started coming up with some of his theories. Some of the top physicists in the world were like, dude, you're you're a nut job. And he's he's literally proving them. But he didn't have he proved them in theory, but he didn't have the means to actually do the experiment to prove his theory. There's a great book that I recommend people read called Proving Einstein Right by Jim Gates that talks about like the hard work that people try to do years after to try to experimentally validate the predictions that Einstein made with with his theories. It's fascinating. Well, yes, at the time, it's kind of crazy when he's saying, yeah, if you look at it back at the time, don't we look at it now and go, well, the guy was a walking genius and he was. But if you go back in time when he was doing it, it was like, what are you talking about? You know? But one of the challenges is your eyewitness. One of the challenges is you're essentially an eyewitness account. Like we don't have good data. We have very limited data of some of the incidents that you've experienced. So let me kind of dig in. Let me just ask some questions of maybe to see if there's just to paint more and more of the picture. One you kind of mentioned to take tax shape. Let's break apart two situations. One is the video. Let's look at the actual account, the eyewitness account that you saw with your own eyes. What's the what can you say about the shape of the thing? Is there interesting aspects outside of the Tic-Tac like is there any appendages? Is there some texture to it that no smooth white? Tic TAC. No, we don't. Yes, there's no no wings, no visible propulsion, no windows. When you probes that we could see, we don't notice. Like I said, we don't see the little things on the bottom of it until we see the video in the TV mode. When it zoomed in right before it's shortly, you kind of see zoom in, you don't see it typically on the YouTube stuff that's out there. Remember, we're looking at the original tape. So there's not there's basically no degradation. But when you saw your eyes, there's no kind of appendage, no know what about like somebody has a lot of people ask you questions. So I appreciate you spending your time here. Let me ask some of them. Did you I mean, you chased it, so we flew close to it, relatively speaking. Was there. Did you feel any wake like any did you feel it in any way in terms of your interaction, like aerodynamically? No, nothing. Nothing. So another aspect of it, there's an interesting thing. You've developed a feel for for objects in the air. Did you feel like it was surprised by your arrival or did it? Let me ask a few questions around it. So did you did it feel like the thing was surprised? Did it feel like it wanted to be seen? Almost to show off its capability, did and did, what did it feel like relative to if you were doing a and er fight against sort of like a, I don't know, a foreign jet. So one, I think I think it knew we were there when we showed up. It's just me. It's kind of like an animal. If you've ever been around deer in a field, you know, the deer will look up and if it sees you and you're on the other side of field, it'll actually go no threat and it'll start eating. You know, they don't put their tail up as you move closer to the deer, then it goes, oh, it's there. And I'm going to react or I'm going to move. So as we were up high and it's down doing whatever it was doing, you know. Which I don't know. Someone asked, what do you think I got maybe was communicating with something I joked on Good Morning America? Maybe it's like talking to the whales, kind of like Star Trek, you know? And I actually use that clip was kind of funny, but yeah, we're a little human centric. We think like it would it show up to talk to us? But maybe he's talking to the dolphin, maybe whatever, because it was hanging around that white water and I don't know. Was there something? There is a segment. We just didn't find it. Again, I don't know. But once we started to descend and it actually reoriented its longitudinal axis and it started mirroring us coming up and it was obviously where we were there and it was really coming up, just, you know, you figure I'm at 20 and it's coming up and it ends up getting up to 12 where I cut across a circle. I think it was very aware that we were there because it interacted. We call it a two circle fight when you're fighting another airplane. But, you know, it was it was. Were we afraid? I don't think so. I mean, and to me, I was more curious. You know, curiosity overcomes any fear that you would have. And I always felt, to be honest, if I was inside the airplane, especially as long as much time as I'd spent inside the airplane flying and doing stuff, I felt totally it was like a safe zone. I mean, I felt totally comfortable inside the airplane as most. You can't if you're in the airplane and you feel scared, it's not the job for you. You have to feel that because the airplane is part of you now. Yes. You know, I am inside. I have the stick, I have the throttles. I've got my window in the back seat. He's running all the displays. We are a team. We're in the state of the art airplane, you know, brand new. You feel pretty good. And then you get something that, you know, can climb from the surface up and then accelerate like it did. Like it was like no big deal, you know, for an airplane. If you just put me from a standstill, let's say slow flight, just get me at one hundred knots above the water. And for me to you can't just start a climb. I'd have to lower the nose. I'd have to accelerate and then I have to start coming up. And this thing just like just did it like it was like no big deal. Yeah. You mentioned that, like kind of your reaction to it. Was it like something that you would love to fly almost this object? Just the curiosity experience is like like would it almost like what the heck is that piece of technology? And I want to fly it. Like, what made you. Feel like it's something that you could fly. Do you think it's something that a human could fly like in terms of interpreting what you saw as a piece of technology? Because another perspective on it is it was not that the thing under the water was the key thing. And what you were seeing is some kind of projection or something that like I don't think it was a projection. I think it was a real object is not a physical hard object that could be flying. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think all for us it is. It was. And it was this was not because you go, OK, let's just go on it. It's a light projection. Well, we were both sitting next to each other. We were looking at it from the exact same angle and all that. And I go, OK, there's the in theory you could have that, but with an eight thousand foot altitude difference flying, you know, and there, you know, she's probably not directly above me. She's kind of hanging out watching this whole thing happen. You know, you're getting two different perspectives from two different altitudes over a clear blue. You know, if you've ever been at sea and I don't mean like coast. I mean like when you get out at sea, the ocean is the bluest. It's incredible. You know, you got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean. You got pretty high contrast. And for this thing just to disappear, it was I'm telling you, I would I mean, I know we we all have the same recollection of what happened. You know, there's some details because it's so long ago. But for the most part, we know what we saw and we all came back and looked at each other like, what the hell was that? What if I mean, do you think about the thing under the water that's not often talked about if there's something under the water, couldn't have been something gigantic. Like it could be what? Like, do you ever see this big ship? I mean, that's why as a person. So I love like swimming out into the ocean. My mom was an Olympic swimmer. So like, I love that feeling. But I'm also terrified when I swim because the if anything could be under there. Like there's not enough focus on that, perhaps because there's no visibility. But it's a I mean, is there anything interesting to say about the possibility there was anything underneath? There could be. I mean, think about if you're going to hide on this planet. Or what's the least explored spot on the planet? Two thirds of it's the ocean. There's there's there's literally I mean, come on the the Malaysia airplane, the triple seven, it was a triple seven that crashed. You know, they turned they didn't go where they're supposed to and they just disappeared. And they've been searching for it and they found pieces of it. But you would think there's large objects that, you know, when that thing hit the water, depending on how it broke up, there's big pieces that would be you'd find something. They haven't found anything except what floated, you know, to hide something underwater. I think it would be easy. So, OK, let's go a little bit of speculation land. But it's the best it's the best we can do, which is the basic question of what do you think? Was it so if you had to put money on it, is it like advanced human created technology? Is it alien technology? Is it an unknown physical phenomena? You know, like ball lightning, for example? There's a lot of fascinating things we humans don't really understand. Is it, like I said, perception, cognition that leads you to some kind of hallucination that made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing? You put those things on the table, or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena like like an ice cloud or something like that? What do you think it was? Oh, it's definitely I don't think it's an ice cloud because ice cores don't fly around and react to you. Do I think it was a light? I'd say no, because of the aspects and what we looked and watched it do, I'd say no. What do you mean by light? Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception. There's there like plasma. You can do plasma and you go, I can see it, but it's really not you know, it's plasma. I don't think so. So we'll see. Distortion's I think. Is it move? Maybe not. I mean, I'm not a theoretical physicist and some you know you know, I'm not at MIT. I would say no. I mean, it looked for from all my experience and I quite a bit of it when this happened. No, I think it was a it was a hard object. It b it was aware that we were there. It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane and I had to come up and do something, exactly what I would do. You know, it mirrored me. It wasn't aggressive. You know, there's Toco at fault behind us and never it was never offensive on us. It never did that. It just mirrored us. So as we're coming on, it's just like, you know, you're you're kind of you know, you said you do martial arts, you know, or wrestling. You know, you see people out on the when they get into the ring, especially with collegiate wrestling, because my roommate in college was a collegiate wrestler. So I de facto became a wrestler because he beat me up every night and we joke. I talk to him literally probably three or four times a week. But, you know, you see wrestlers when they get out, they kind of you're kind of feeling as you walk and boxers do the same thing. It was doing that same thing. It's like what's going on as it comes around, as it comes around. And then it was like, hey, we're going to get here. And when I get too close to it, you know, it decided I'm out of here. And then it did something that we've never seen. The other question is, what if I didn't cut across the circle? What if I just kept going around a circle would just keep going. I kind of just watch. I my one regret out of the whole thing is we have a camera in our helmet, in the joint helmet. There's a little camera, but we never use it because it's nauseating to watch. Because you've ever put a GoPro on someone's head where they're looking around like this all the time, it'll it'll nauseate you. So we never turn that on and all, you know, it's the one thing I didn't do is reach down and hit the switch, you know, and then we didn't go back. And because our tapes didn't have anything, because we didn't get it on radar, because I tried to lock it up, because I can move the radar with my head, but I couldn't it wouldn't lock the radar would lock. And so so then the question is, and this is unanswerable, but let's try to get some hints at it. Do you think it's human, like advanced human created technology that's simply top secret that was just not aware of or is it not something not of this world? So you if you were to ask me in two thousand four, I just said, I don't know if you ask me now. So we're coming up on sixteen years ago. For a technology like that, you know, and let's assume that it didn't have a conventional propulsion system because I don't think it did. I would like to think that if we had a technology that would advance mankind leaps and bounds from what we normally do, then it would start coming out. But to hide something like that for 16 years, you know, and I understand, you know, and I don't speak for the United States government, I never will speak for the United States. But I understand how some of that stuff works for classification levels and why we classify stuff. You know, is it is it detrimental to national defense? But there's a point where you have to look and go. If we had a technology like this that could literally change the way mankind travels, how we get things into space, our ability to do things, you know, you talk about, you know, are we going to go to Mars? Well, if you have something that has the ability to go, because, remember, these things were coming down when the crews were tracked him from above 8000 feet, which is space, and they would come down and they would come straight down. They'd hang out at like 20000 feet. And then three or four hours later, they'd go back up. We don't have anything that can come down, hang out in once. And I'm talking hold out in a spot where we all know there's winds. They're not drifting like a balloon. They're just sitting there. And then they would go back up and they tracked up to the when I talked to the controller, he's like, we've seen up to ten of these things. There's other guys. And it was raining and all this other let's just say they tracked a group of these things coming down, hanging out and going up. So it's not just propulsion and the way it moves, it's also fuel. It's everything. So the whole the whole of it indicates of the kind of technology that's highly advanced. But you don't think in your sense that you actually don't know. But you know, more than a lot of people in your sense, the top secret military technology, if you think about skunkworks, you think about like that cannot be more than 15 years ahead. I would say, for a leap like that and a perfect example in modern times is the 117, because now a lot of the data on the 117 is out like it was developed at this time. It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged by the United States government. What's the 117? That's the stealth fighter, the original stealth fighter. Not to be too, but the stealth fighter. So he look at that, you know. Yeah, you can I think you can hide things for a while. But I think a technology elite I mean, this is not this is not a hey, we developed this and we're kind of pushing the edge of technology. This is a giant leap in technology, you know, and the other one is, do we have the basis to do that? You know, because usually when you have a technology like that, universities, especially when you're working at MIT, a lot of the leading edge stuff is coming out of the top tier universities, you know, so you've got MIT, you've got Caltech, you've got Stanford, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, Carnegie Mellon. I'm just naming schools. Naval Postgraduate School is another one. There's usually indicators. There's papers of, hey, this is where we're going. I don't think there's a whole bunch of papers on developing a gravity based propulsion system that literally I've got an object because how do you how much power would it cost to create a gravity field of your own that could actually be strong enough to counter the giant orb that we live on? So, by the way, you mentioned gravity based. That's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do in terms of propulsion, like what kind of propulsion would have to. Would have to be involved in order to result in that kind of movement, to me, all the gravity discussions. It seems insane from a physics perspective, but of course. It would seem insane until it's not, but because remember, we only know what we know. Yeah, and which is very little. And someone has to think out of the box to go, is this possible at all? Yeah. Well, OK, so this so you're saying that if you had to bet money all your money, it would be something that's. Alien technology, so it's not human created technology. Well, I don't like to get into little green men, but I would say that I don't I don't think we would have made it right. I don't think we have developed it. I just you know, because the other one, someone asked me, they said, what if there wasn't maybe it was just a drone, maybe it was a wave that got sent here from someplace else. I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around. So I don't I don't know, I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some of the the giant brains that think this stuff up, I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of them, but such a topic, which you mean look for drones for just a just space travel technology. Because if you look at where we're going, you know, because everyone talks about Mars. OK, and, you know, we're here, we're gonna be able to colonize, you know, and I know Ellen is big into that, you know. Yeah. What do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA? We put humans back up, back up there. My theory. So it's funny because I know one of the guys that was he was he was one of the original employees at SpaceX. He's a friend of mine. And I won't say his name, but he knows Elon. He knows Elon. And and he actually worked on the entire Falcon one project. He's one of the guys on that. So he's got some great stuff. Matter of fact, he's there's a movie there's a book coming out that comes out in about a year on this, the original the first years of space for six years of SpaceX, you know, and he's named in the book, you know, and they're supposed to make a movie on it. So I'm like, hey, who's going to school? But what he's done to me, it changed the game. And here's why. Because I said, you know, I think it was 62. And Eisenhower warned of the industrial defense complex, you know, which it has become. Everything he warned us of, you know, it has become and it's really driven by there's the big three in defense, which is really, you know, Northrop, Lockheed and Boeing. Those are the big those are your biggest. And Raytheon's kind of like a subset of that. But they're right to be in US defense. Those are the big guys, right. That's actually where a lot of military guys go when they retire. They go to stuff like that. So when you look at that and you go in the way government contracting is working and how we charge and you know why things cost so much, and then you go, you got Elon who's got an ego, you know, and he doesn't like to do things a certain way. And I've talked to the guy that worked there on, you know, because the government likes to have oversight of contracts where he was like, no, just tell me what you want. I'll build it. I'll give you a bill when it's done. And then if I do it for half the price, I make a ton of money because he's money driven guy, which I like capitalism at its best. And so now you look at the two things. So you got the space X, which is the Dragon capsule, right. And then you've got Boeing. So Elon did what Boeing is contracted to do in less time for half the money and oh, by the way, because he can reuse the boosters because they come back and land and you don't have to like Morton Thiokol. We used him on the space shuttle, but they had to take them all apart and do a bunch of stuff because they landed in saltwater and he had to put them all back together where Elon gets them down because I was joking with this guy. What do they do? Do they like Rip Rehaul know? It's not actually they clean them up and they can use them again, reusable systems, incredible leap in technology that no one thought of. But here's a private company. So being able to put people on and the capsule and the spacesuits, I mean, it's literally like sci fi when you watch when they want up. So I'm a huge fan of what he and his company have been able to do because, you know, the fact that we were paying huge amounts of money to the Russian government, you know, and oh, by the way, if you didn't know because I have some friends that are astronauts, they all have to learn Russian. Right? They have to. And they have to do it's what level five where the test is a phone call where they call you up and they, you know, because they would go. So I went to the pinning it to two friends of mine. The one actually had a mission date. The one got one later. So it's cool when you're watching your friends doing a spacewalk, you know, because I would pull up because if I knew it was going on, I pull up the NASA thing. I was in a meeting one day and I've got NASA on and makers out there floating around, you know, doing stuff. And I saw one. He's in the space station. Why they're doing a spacewalk. So it's kind of cool when you go, oh, I know that dude. He's up there in space floating around. So when you when you look at what those they're capable of doing and then you go what Elon is bringing to the fact that now it's back in America, it's actually. To me, it's it's cost effective for us to be able to do more stuff, I think it opens the door to do we go back to the moon? Is there a reason to go back to the moon? Personally, I think if we're going to if they're really going to go, you know, in years from now go to Mars, I think that the moon is the stepping stone to go back, to start proving some of the technology to go, hey, we can build this, we can get on the moon, and now we can get back off the moon because we did this on a less than a compact computer in the 60s, which is the whole reason that I flew because I'm obsessed. Matter of fact, I have the giant Lego Apollo at home and the lander and I have one that my dad built me in 1969 right after that. And Neil Armstrong is an Ohio boy and so am I. I have a picture of him in a car in Wapakoneta, Ohio, at the parade after he walked on the moon because his parents didn't live far from my uncle in Wapakoneta and they were out at the parade. So I've been obsessed with this since I was a child. Do you hope to do you think do you hope that you'll go out to the space one day? Me, if if I had the opportunity, I'd go in a second. You know, I am not. I mean, that's one of the hopes of the commercial space flight, is that, you know, like people like I mean, it would be to us tourism, but you certainly wouldn't want to in terms of, you know, kind of a civilian. Right. I mean, in a sense that you're in just a normal person. You're not a fighter jet pilot currently. But it seems like if we send a civilian up, there would be somebody like you in the next like 20 years. I'd be you know, if Ilan wants to throw me out, want those things, I'd be all over it. And my wife would say, but, you know, sometimes you got to get your kicks while you're alive. I'd love to hear that discussed with your wife. Listen, there's the pros and cons. She's she's I mean, I've known on board high school, so she she knows how I am. You know, most people that know me are like, yeah, you're pretty much the same person. You were in high school. You know, I was the class clown and I still am that way. So let me ask you this question about so I'm talking to you on again soon. I'm curious to get your perspective on it. If I wanted to talk to you about Tic TAC, about these weird out there propulsion ideas, which are obviously just like you said, if there's something to it, if it can be investigated somehow, it would be extremely useful for us to understand in the effort of developing propulsion systems that can get us cheaply to outer space. What what should Elon think about the stuff? What should he do? What should people like him? I think people need to open their aperture up and stay off of it, take the next step and go. You know, we are tied to fuels in either solid rocket or liquid or, you know, whatever we do. But it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas to create thrust, which is really in a in layman's terms, you know, we can get into what but that's what it does. If you have something that you can contain, that is as a fuel source, that would last a significant amount of time. You know, those rocket boosters go and when they're done, they're done. There's enough to get them back down. That's it. There's not a huge, you know, not coming back and going, oh, I still got three quarters of a tank. Let's pull them out and do it again. His system's not doing that. But you know, the way the way contracting, especially in the government, the government has tons of money. But you got to remember that the government has to justify how they spend our tax dollars. For the most part, there's times where they can hide money in the budget to get stuff done. But then when you look at I'm just going to throw a few out there. But if you look at. What Amazon, you know, does with Bezos and you've got Elon, there's some there's some big money out there. I mean, you're talking you know, Bezos alone could buy companies like big companies. Apple is another one of these companies that huge, huge amounts of money. And then just go over to the Gates Foundation and they've got gazillions and gazillions of dollars. We've got universities. There's so much money out there if we really want it to do it, aside from what the government wants to do, because we do live in a free society. I think there's enough to go. How do we do this, and because when you work outside of what the government would want to do, let's go. Let's not we're not working on this necessarily for the United States. Although I am a huge giant, I will be American. I would never I am an American talking to somebody born. And so I can't believe you agreed to this. But but when I, you know, haven't killed me yet, if you're here and you've been here for a while, then I'm joking. I'm an American citizen. I'm actually pretty much American when you do that. So you look at let's just look at American universities. Yes. So there's some brilliant minds and we'll just use that MIT because you worked on there. There's some brilliant minds, but there's a huge chunk of those brilliant minds that are not American citizens. So if you want to get into government stuff and you are not an American citizen, it gets really, really, really hard. But if I take money like Bezos money, Elon money and they let's just say they want to work together, they can split it up 50/50, the two of them, when the technology gets developed. But now I'm not constrained by who has to do the work. I just want to make sure that I try and keep it in the United States because technology is technology. And if it gets developed and gets over to where, you know, a country gets a hold of it and then just basically uses it for their own because you save them all the research time, you don't want to do that. But if we can get to the point where we can we do it on the International Space Station, we realize that space was too expensive for one country to do alone. So we made the International Space Station and we have a conglomerate. It's the one thing that the Russians and the US actually work together on. Think about it. That's it. We work together on space because we realize it's way too expensive for us to do alone and effective. So we've got this thing that's been out there floating around for God. Now, what is it like 20 years? That thing's been up there floating around. So it's getting old. We're going to have to replace parts and do stuff. But if we can pull the money together and come up with something that would literally change mankind and change travel and allow us to actually do a more effective thing of exploring, because if you develop that technology, I'm not you don't even have to send a manned person if you can develop a technology. That's so with our automation and we're progressing in our computing power to send something out that's not just floating around when, you know, that can react a lot quicker to something that could actually go down to the surface and come back up. So right now, everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there and it just sends data back in and analyze. But if I got a technology that can go up there really quick, I'm not worried about man. I don't have life support systems and all that. But it can go down. It can go. It can cruise around. It can hover above. It can take samples and it can actually take Martian soil and then bring it back. Yeah. So we can analyze it here. That's a game changer. Yeah, it's a complete game changer because it opens up all the planets. Exactly. So in a sense the the Tic-Tac is a symbol. So whatever you think you want from a debunking perspective, there's a non-zero probability that it's alien technology. And in that sense it serves as a beacon of hope and a reason to, like you said, widen the aperture and to invest big amounts of money into thinking outside the box like it's almost the I hope. To say we can do better propulsion, we can overcome physics in an order of magnitude, better way, and it's worthwhile to try, I think and I don't think the money if you look at the big picture with the amount of money, some of that's out there floating around these private companies, you know, I think if you said, hey, I've got let's just say one hundred million dollars, which really a hundred million dollars relative to Basils has got one hundred and some billion dollars that we're in. So if he said one 100 million dollars, you drop a hundred million dollars and I go and I'm going to put a you know, like the government will send a broader announcement out that says, hey, we're looking for this technology or a DARPA program. But what if I just said, hey, who's to stop Bezos and Elon from doing that on their own, to say, hey, I want to go to university because there are fewer restrictions because it's not tax dollars. They don't have the checks and they can do whatever they want. So their money. I'm sorry about that to go, hey, I'm going to put this out and I'm going to get the best physicists that are working at CERN, that are at MIT, that are at Caltech, at the school, as I mentioned. And you know, by the way, a few of these guys are propulsion experts. And I'm going to basically I'm going to fund you guys for ten years so you get ten million dollars a year. And I'm going to give you your salaries and we're going to do that or whatever the amount works. So let's cut it down to five so we can pay you. Well, right. To do the research. But, oh, by the way, the research is it's not classified, but it's controlled. So we're not going to publicly just put this out in journals. But if we make a leap that we think would advance because although those let's say there's ten of them, those 10 scientists come up with something and they put out a paper, there might be another a number 11 at another university that reads that paper and says, hey, I kind of had this idea and now you can get a thought pool that pushes this in and gets us out of the the mindset because we have a tendency to we evolve the stuff that we create. But it's like I was joking because I know a ton of guys with PhDs and girls. And I said, but you know how much when a person gets a Ph.D. in like engineering, how much new math is really being done? I said there's a handful of people in the world that are really doing I'm talking I'm talking Steven Hawkins type brilliance that is going I'm really doing something that's. Yeah, that's totally different. That's a big dramatic thing now going on in physics, that this is just everybody's converge towards this local minima or local maximum. We think about it and it's it's again, same as with the Tic-Tac thinking outside the box is not is not accepted. And it probably should be. But it is hard because if you go back, go back to Einstein, back to the original. He was the he was out of the box. Yeah. He did not think the he not thought out of the box and came up with some of his theories. Where would we be. OK, we jumping around a little bit. So we talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space. But let's let me jump back to a few questions that folks had. I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff because I think not the actual idea, not the actual facts of the debunking, but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers hurts my heart a little bit because people are just talking past each other. But let me kind of bring it up, make w. I've just recently started to pay attention just in preparing to talk to you about this world, and Nicole is one of the better known people who kind of makes a career out of trying to debunk sort of his his natural approach to all situations is that of a skeptic. I think it's it's very useful and powerful, especially for me, coming from a scientific perspective to take the approach he does. It's valuable. And I think no matter what, I think there's a hope that people, quote unquote, true believers, are a little bit more open minded to the work of MidCoast. I think it's quite useful and brilliant work. So let me ask here's a bunch of videos, a bunch of ideas where he kind of suggests possible other explanations of the things that were out there. He has some explanations of the things that you've seen in it with the Tic-Tac, like with your own eyes, like he says that it's possible that you miscalculated the size and the distance of the thing and so on when you were flying. I don't fight that as I mean, maybe you can comment on that. But first, let me do it right now. Sure. So because that comes up like how how did you know it was about 40 feet long? I go, OK, so 16 years fine against other airplanes. Know what stuff looks like? You know, I've looked down on things. So if I know, I know. Here's the known things I know. When we saw the Tic-Tac, I was at twenty thousand feet ish right around there. So when I look down, I know what a horn it looks like looking down on him because I've done it for all those years. I mean, I got a good idea. So that's that's why I said 40 feet, because it's about Kornet size. So and as I go around, you get to the point where you have to be able to judge distance when we fly out of experience and you can tell if something small or big, you know. So I would argue the fact of, you know, pure experiencers, you know, professional observers, which is what we're actually trained to do. And having done it for so long now, it was and everyone came back with the same thing. They're like is about size Hornet from a human factors perspective, how often in your experience of those 16 years do you find that is what you see is the incorrect state of things? So like, how often do you make mistakes with vision? You actually you make vision issues a lot because you're and the sad part is, is your brain believes what your eyes see. We are actually trained to do the opposite of that, especially when you instrument fly because your brain and I can tell you one thing, but you got to trust your instincts. Let's go back to landing at night so your eyes do that. Yeah. Landed like that. Zoom that the runway and your brain assumes that the runway is fixed, but you know that the runway is moving. So if I try and do stuff visually, I would you die every time, but not every time. But you die close to every time trying to land on a boat. So we actually use instruments which are counter to your brain. So and there's actually all kinds of things that we go through and training. They have this thing and think they still use it. It's called the MSD Multi Spatial Disorientation Device or the spin and puch. It looks like a giant carousel and you're in these little modules and when you get out, you think the thing goes really fast and they can you can make yourself think that I'm descending or climbing. But you're actually only going around in circles at a very slow rate as fast as a human can talk. But as they spin you around and a little something and slow it down, a speed it up, your body does this and you you know, and then by visuals of showing you, like, they can spin it sideways to the outside wall, but they can show like lines that are they can make the line stand still because they're moving the same velocity they the other way. And you'll think you're screaming. You see it in amusement parks all the time. You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A, but you're really not doing you're sitting there. So we get trained on all that stuff. So if you if you want to look at it and go, well, you're you're disoriented. You're the Sybylla, I'd argue going, no, I'm not. Because, you know, when I'm flying the airplane, even as I'm looking at the Tic TAC, I've got a heads up display that tells me what my airplane's doing. So I've got I know what I'm doing. I can look outside, I've got a sense of what I'm doing, but I'm also looking inside to crosscheck of what I'm seeing is in reality, what I'm. Do you actually your brain gotten good at combining, almost adding extra sensory information. You have to you have like supervision. So you're combining what you're seeing and adjusting what the sensors, what you call the instruments and giving you. And that that in turn is a loop that adjusts the perception system that like that that adjusts your brain's interpretation of what you're saying. You'd be amazed at how good. So here's here's another example. So if we go out over the water so there's no land in sight and we're going to fight. So when we fight two airplanes, we're going to dogfight as an instructor. And I was for most of my time, you have to come back and you have to recreate it. So we call it drawing arrows. So you have to recreate that stuff so you get pretty good at going. Like, I would take off and say, all right, we're starting heading due east and I know where the sun is at because in the short couple of minutes we're going to fight. The sun's really not going to move much. It's going to be in a row. So I know that the sun is at, you know, let's just say one nine five degrees. Right. So I'm starting going east and it's actually be down off my right hand side. So now I know as I'm fighting because in the water you don't have any reference. Like I passed land, I passed like, no, you don't. And you can't use clouds because clouds do move. But you got to come back because you go, here's where I started and then you went. As soon as you end, you go, all right. I ended heading three, four, five. And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns and use the sun relatives. You can create this entire battle that went on with arrows that you can come back and debrief the guy that you were teaching on exactly what happened. And you get really, really good at that. So when you come up and go, well, Dave, how do you know you were at six o'clock and you went around and he came up here I go, because I'm trained to do all that and I take all the notes why I'm flying. You can do it, but usually you memorize it all and you get done and you read as soon as you're done, you knock it off. You look at the other airplane, you get set and you start writing all your notes down. Yeah. And you're writing it really fast on your car. And you go out the stack of cards and you stick a new one on your keyboard card. You ready to go? And here's the next set up. It's kind of it's in some way similar to what like at the at the highest level chess players do. I mean, you're I mean, they they they recap the games, but the the richness of the representation that they use and remembering like how the games evolved, it's not like it's much richer than the actual moves. It's like these a bunch of patterns that are hard to put into words like like all the richness of thinking they have about the way the game evolved. It's more like instinctual from years and years of experience. So they try to put it into words, but they really can't. It's it's just not I understand it. It's because for us, if we don't come back with anything, then there's no learning to be had because the whole thing is the de-brief. When we get back and we talk about that's really where the learning is. And it's the same thing. If you want to go back to chess, you know, and you start off, you try and learn because you're remembering what you're doing. If you play against someone, I'm always a big place. Play with someone better than you. That's how you learn if you're constantly beating people, you're not learning anything, you're just learning that they're not good. And you're better when you when you challenge yourself against someone that is going to is better than you. You learn. So I learned how to fight an airplane with. He's actually one of my best friends. We'll call him Tom. I won't give us call because because he wasn't. So Tom took me out and taught me how to fight because Tom had just left OPCON. He was the the training officer Top Gun, which. So that's the guy. The training officer is the main guy at Top Gun. So Tom was a training officer talking to Tom when I learned because I come out a six and we really don't fight because it was a bomber. So I get in fat and I want to learn how to fight because it's a whole other side of the mission. It's the F and F fighter attack, the fattiness fighter attack. So I had to learn how to fight. So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the world. He's going to teach me how to do it. And he did and I would do something and then he would go, I get to a situation where I had never been, and then I would go, well, going to do this. And then he would destroy me and he would come back and go, Here's why you don't do that. And then I would take that knowledge and I would put it in my little basket of tricks. And over time, because, you know, no one walks out into that world. I don't care how gifted an aviator and go. I am the man or the woman. I am it. No, it's a learning process. And so are all those years you've gotten good. So, I mean, so what are the chances that your eyes betrays you when you saw the Tic-Tac? Low zero. Well, I mean, I'm not so naive, I am ninety nine point nine percent, so point one percent, my eyes deceive me. But remember, if it deceived me, it had to deceive the other four people. The percentage is even lower. Yeah, well, I don't find that particularly the case that you saw, but I'm glad you put it. You you said those words out loud. So for me, from my perspective, coming into this world and looking at it, I'm a little bit more skeptical. So you're I I think is the most fascinating story and that I think that's inspiring to me and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists out there on so many levels, just like I was at an engineering level, that maybe there's propulsion systems we can actually build that can do some crazy, amazing stuff. So it's at the very least intriguing and at the best inspiring. I just want to say that but on the video side, it's like it's. The videos for the flare video that go fast and the Gambo video, they are only interesting to me, to me in the context of your story, like without that, they're kind of low resolution. It's like it it's easier to build a debunking story to be skeptical. So that's just where I'm coming from. Maybe you can convince me otherwise. But so to bring up MapQuest one more time. He looks at the flair video and he says that one of the most amazing video parts of the video for people who haven't seen it is at the end of it the the the Tic-Tac. Flies or appears to fly very quickly to the left of the screen, off the screen. And what makes us says is that, you know, MapQuest, probably others, that the way to explain that is the tracking system. Like we said, it's vision based tracking simply loses the like the object, the tracking loses it. And so it simply allows the object to float off screen because it's no longer tracking it. So I find that at least a plausible explanation of that video looking at your face. You do not. So can you maybe comment to that to that debunking aspect? So it's funny how people can extrapolate stuff who've never operated the system, know for sure. And that's like me going because I'm a big Formula One fan, you know, that's like me going, oh, my God, Lewis, what were you doing? You could have done this with the car and you to win the race. You know, and Lewis Hamilton right now is, you know, defending world champion two times four time four or five time world champion. But that would be pretty stupid of me to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car or a matter of fact, anyone driving a Formula One car. So I can't tell you how many times of watching you. You remember when we looked at this thing, when it when when Chad came back with the video, we sat and watched it. I mean, I can't tell you how many times I watched it off the original tapes going on. Right. Right. All right. Let's look at this, you know, because you can look and see where the you can see where the airplane is going. You can see if it's looking left or right. And if you actually watch all that stuff, it doesn't do that. It actually when the vehicle starts to move to the bars, the tracking gate starts to open up. And the people at Raytheon could probably add to this because they built upon the tracking. It'll start to open up. And but the thing when it leaves so fast off the screen, the pod can't move fast enough. It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around, because there's another theory that, oh, the pods looking forward when the pod passes underneath the airplane. So if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me, as does this, the ball will actually flip around to kind of finish off. And it'll it'll it swaptions because it has you know, it's a gimbal. It it can't just it's not free floating, but there's a theory on one of them. Oh, it's here. And it flipped over. It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front, it stays like this. So yet another another debunker who doesn't know this. So, you know, an MC has had several theories on other of some of the other videos, like one of them, the go fast is a bird. And Jeremy Corbyn actually did the balloon of saying, no, it's not because he's on he's on black hot. So the white object is actually colder than the ocean that's flying. Well, birds aren't colder than the ocean. They'd be dead. So the Gimbel video to comment on the amazing aspect of that video is the rotation, the apparent rotation of the object. That is something that is not possible to do with systems that we know of. And us suggest that a flare like reflections or whatever can explain. Now, what McMath's doesn't see is so when they take because I've talked to the one of them actually I work with. So I know him. I know I talked to him all the time. So and it's his best friend actually shot the video, one of his best friends. But they give you a video game of a both of them the go fast in the or shot by the same person. OK, so and they were in each other's wedding. So that's how well they know each other. OK, so what you don't see is so the airplanes are flying still Super Hornets, but they have the RPG seventy nine, which is the new phased array radar that's made by Raytheon. Things incredible. OK, it doesn't usually if it's if it's out there and it sees it, it's real. So at first they thought they were ghost tracks when they started seeing stuff. And then they actually through one of the targeting pods out there. Well, the targeting potboilers, heat signature and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's there. It's real. It's not you're not picking up some extraneous thing. So what you see in the gimbal video of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit, look at that thing. It's just sitting there and it's in the wind and it's going against the wind. Why it's doing this, you know, someone goes, oh, it's an airplane. No, if an airplane does this, it's eventually going to start to change aspect because it's in a turn. This thing doesn't change aspect. It just is just routine. Right. The other thing that you see when you talk to them is so they're on their radar. There's an object that they identify is their number one priority over their launch and steering. So when they designate that, that's where the targeting pod is going to look. That's what you get on the gimbal video. There's five other I think it's five. They're kind of in a V, you know, like a geese would fly that are out in front of it. And they're actually coming. They're out in front of it and they actually turn on the radar and go the other way while they're filming the GIMPLE video, which it's I know Ryan has come out and talked about it, but but when you see it, you go, you know, if you take it in context because you go, oh, it's just the video. Well, if you take the video with the radar going, no, there's actually other. Things out there, because there's at least 60 people that have seen these things on radar, off the vacates, it was it actually became the I called a buddy of mine who is running the wing at the time, the fighter wing. I said, what are you guys doing about this? He goes, Well, we got a NOTAM out, which is a notice to airmen, which means there's these objects out there in the warning area. So anyone can you can fly a Cessna through the air. It's all the warning area tells you that there's high military traffic and training out here. It's probably best not to be here, but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there. So these things have the right, wherever they're from or whatever they are, you know, because people are like other balloons. Well, balloons float, balloons don't sit in 70 knots. A wind stay in the same location. They say they had an airplane because it was two. There's the gimbal thing. That's a pretty big object. There's also they talk about it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere, a translucence view. What the hell is that? And I've heard you almost hit one. It's almost hit hit them. So that's another that's one of the biggest another biggest account. It's like almost hit a plane, something that appeared to be a Cuban and translucent sphere. What do you make of that? And you know what I mean, that that's the most dangerous. You're right, the biggest frustration is when you do that and you go, OK, so this thing passed between two airplanes. And it was I think it was like 100 feet or something like that of the airplane. It almost hit it. So what they do is they come back and go, hey, I had a near midair would you have in your midair with this floating beachball with a cube inside of it and you go, huh? You know, so they send out a NOTAM again and they they do a what's called a hazard report that says, hey, there's these objects out there. We almost hit one area and that gets sent off to the Naval Safety Center. What was done? I mean, what are you going to do? You can, you know, catch one, go out with a giant net and try and bag one, you know, because they've seen them. They picked them up, like hovering on radar. And then all of a sudden they're traveling at really high rates of speed. So, you know, you do what? Yeah. What are you going to do? Well, let me ask this, because this is what people kind of think about after you witness Tic-Tac and after this these incidents, as far as we know, with the gimble and the go fast. It seems like people in the military did not or did not react like what, like did not freak out, it almost like was like a mundane event. How do you explain that? Why didn't the people on the ship, not the higher ups, why wasn't there a big freak out? Or as some people suggest, the higher ups knew about it all along and just were not letting everyone know that there's some kind of secret military, you know, like like tests almost. So let's talk about so let's say you've got this cool new toy you call the cool new toy. You typically don't take your cool new toy out into an area where the cool new toy could get damaged. Or what if the airplane would have actually hit your cool new toy and you got two people that are ejecting or dead and you got a, you know, 80 million dollar airplane that's now in the bottom of the Atlantic. You know, tests are normally done in controlled environments, just like any test lab test or whatever. When you take things out into the real world, you know, you're still going to test it in an area where if something goes wrong. So when they started and we'll go back to Elon, so my friend that worked there, they had a rocket go off. They were out in Kwajalein. And when the rocket went up, a fuel line ruptured in the rocket and it ran out of fuel before it got all the way up and it came falling back down. Well, when you're out on an aitel in the Pacific, if it's going up above you, the worst case is going to land on you. So you're worried about where else is it going to land? And it actually crashed next to the atoll. And Ellen, was it happy and threw this guy under the bus? So that's a test environment because you don't know what's going to happen. So because someone said, well, when we chase the Tic-Tac, well, it could have been some secret government thing. Well, secret government things typically just don't come out and test to where there's no knowing pilots. We can't control a lot of things. You're exactly right. So you go you know, it's you know, it's not the Dr. Evil Scientist that's going to throw shit out there to get there's control. And there's reasons that we do it, because a lot of stuff, especially when you get to there's there's you build something in theory, you model it, you go, hey, this is it looks like it's going to work. You get funding, you build it, you test it some more, you bench test it. You know, you like an airplane with digital flight controls before it even leaves the ground. They've got things over the prostatic system that are changing the what the airplane thinks is the airspeed talking to it. And it's probably up on Banjaxed. So the gear up. So it doesn't it thinks it's flying. It doesn't know it's sitting on Jack stands and they're just changing the pressure on the prostatic system so they can actually make the flight controls move and they can get all the data back to go. Hey, it looks like it's going to work. And then there's there's a bunch of stuff that they do that's a controlled environment, which you can do the testing. Yeah. Throwing shit out in the middle of where people are doing exercises is the most preposterous thing that I've heard. Is it possible? Yes. Is it more really is it is it is it more likely? More likely they're not doing that than the other? The other side of that question is, why do you think people on the Nimitz and in the US government in general not freak out more at the incredible thing that you've seen, freak out in a positive way, freak out in the negative way, like what are the Russians up to again or or more like what is this like, more turmoil? So the ranks if you were to put a Chinese flag on the side of it or a Russian flag on the side of it, I said, yeah, it had a big Russian flag on the side of it, dude. Then it would have got a lot of attention. It would have sent high order. Yeah, right. If it was you don't have to say Russia or China. Just say if there was another country's emblem on the side of this thing that we saw and said, oh, it belonged to them, then it's a big deal. So here's what's going on. So we're literally in the middle of workups and it was a joint work up. Normally they we go out for a month, go come back, do stuff, go out for a month. This was a two month at sea period where we actually had to beg for them to let us when the ship pulled in at Thanksgiving so we could run home up to the Central Valley, have Thanksgiving with our family and and run back down and do this. OK, so. You know, and I had just taken a ride, had the squadron for a month. Right, so I'm a brand new CEO, I'm the most junior guy on the business as far as a commanding officer goes for time in the Navy. And actually at the time, I think it was the most junior CEO for 05 command in the Navy. Right. So you go, OK, so I'm out here. I got my squadron, I'm running it. I see this thing, you know, we get shit for it. I have a squadron to run. I have the the Tic TAC was over here. And although an extraordinary event, I have 17 aircrew and three hundred sailors that I'm responsible for their well-being, making sure they're fed, making sure they're happy, they're burning, you know, and I'm working with my master chief and I'm working with my XO snap and we're going through all this stuff. I don't have a lot of time to worry about the ticktock and if people need to talk to me. So you got to remember you got the captain of the ship, you got the air wing commander and you got the admiral. Those are the top three. And you got the CEO of the the Princeton who is a major command guy. And that's really your big major command. And then everything else is you got all the squadrons, which are five command and you got the small boys that are out there, which is 005 command. So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility of what's going on, I'm pretty much in the top 20 with all my peers. And then I've got obviously the captain and the admiral. Right. And then he's got some post command guys on his staff that we were friends with. I talked to responsible for a lot of things. Yes. Oh, yeah. The schedule. Yeah. His missions. You have to do a lot, get the job done and there's no time for silly things. That's exactly right. So and we're the we're the integration. You want to win a battle group deploys, especially when you go to the Middle East for what we were doing. The air power is the key. It's we take our airport with us. We can park it anywhere we want and we can do what we need to do. So we're kind of key players. So when you get the theory that all these men in suits showed up, so the captain, the ship never said anything to me, to admiral, never saying to the people on his staff that I was friends with, never saying to me, the other CEOs that I talked to on a daily basis never said anything to me. And no one ever came and talked to me. And I'm the guy that chased it. So in all the theories and all the debunkers and all the stories, because I don't know if people think they're going to get rich on this because I made a big doughnut on this. I can tell you what I got paid for. I got paid to go out and spend twenty one hours of my day going to L.A. and do a five minute talk for someone. I'm like, and it wasn't for the talk because I'll talk for free because you're not paying me. I said, I said. And then I got paid to go to the McMinnville Fest because they my, my wife and I got to go because it was just look like fun because the whole town gets involved. Yeah. And it's the only time I've ever spoken publicly in front of a large audience about this because it was just, you know, it was fun. And I got asked and Jeremy and George, it happened, what, the year before. So I went with Bob Lazaar. So I got to hang out with Bob and his wife and his wife and my wife. And, you know, we all hung out, kind of, you know, talking about UFO stuff, but just getting to know each other as people because, you know, Bob's like me. The stuff that he talks about is not the center of his life. If anything, it ruined his life. Yeah. You know, he's just a really, really smart guy. That's just like the rest of us trying to get through life. Yeah, that's nevertheless. I mean, that was one of the sad things reading Lucha Lozano's resignation note from his that he was a program director at the Aztek program. Yeah, one of the sad things is that he's mentioned that, you know, people in government just don't take this seriously as a threat, like UFOs, as a threat. Like you said, if it doesn't have a Russian label on it, it's a sad thing to think about that, that we have such a busy schedule that the anomaly. It doesn't is distraction that we don't want to deal with, and it kind of just fades into history, like literally it's kind of sad to think that if aliens showed up. Like, and it just didn't because they're not like when aliens show up, they're not going to be a thing that's on the schedule and if they don't start killing people, they just kind of show up in some very nonchalant, peaceful way. Briefly, people will be like, that's that. That's I don't have time for this. That's so sad. It's like anywhere in the world. So, you know, go back. Let's go back. Way back, way back in the time machine, you know, there were people kind of scattered around the globe. You know, in Europe is a perfect example. Why does France speak French and then right next to them, Spanish? Spain speaks Spanish and they need to kind of jump over and Germans or German and the Polish people, everyone speaks a different language, because if you look at the way the train kind of subdivide the original people that were there, you know, thousands of years ago, they speak differently. Right. You'd be like the US. But see, the U.S. is different. We all speak English because what happened, we came over and we started on the East Coast and we migrated west. We will get into the what happened. And, you know, because the Native Americans all spoke different languages. Yeah. You know, it's that same type of thing. So but any time we have a tendency to show up, you're you're actually you think about you're an alien. If I go to a different area, if I just, you know, go back 500 years were over a thousand years or travel. We weren't traveling across oceans at the time. We were well, we don't think we were. The Vikings were because we had limited you know, we had to have supplies in the boats weren't as big. We had to build them by hand. We didn't have power tools and all that stuff. So, you know, if you show up someplace like when the conquistadors from Spain came over into South America and you've got, you know, the natives, you're actually an alien, you know, and then you look at what typically happens when aliens show up in a human alien world, you know, and when I say alien, I mean, you are not from that area. The other. We we take what we want, and that's what happened, I mean, we literally defunct, did civilisation's because that's how we are, you know, humans are we're an interesting group. So you go now what what if something is from someplace else? Just let's just let's just go off the grid and go. Let's say there are little green men and what are their intentions? Who asked me this when we were talking to Louisana? And he said, what do you think they were here for us? I don't know. He goes where I go, Oh, they were observing. They come down and hang out. And he goes, What if they are prepping the battlefield? What if they were observing to figure out what we do? And you go, that's interesting. The other theory is maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here and they just check in on us because the threat to an advanced civilization is when a civilization that's inferior to them actually develops enough and fast enough to become equal or above, because now these they become the threat and type. So you watch us grow until we start getting too much. You know, it's kind of like you go well, because they always have a tendency to hang out around nuclear. Right. And you go, well, you know, if this is an advanced civilization, I'm going to go science fiction kind of comical. They come down and watch it and go look at the the crazy upright monkeys now have developed the atom bomb. Let's hope they don't destroy themself. Yeah. If I was an alien civilization, I would start paying attention with the atom bomb. That's why the I mean, there's certainly an uptick of what is it, UFO sightings since. Since the nuclear. Since the nuclear. Yeah, that's you go. Hmmm. Let me ask a little bit out there. Question, maybe speculation, but maybe touching on Roswell. Do you think it's possible that there is? Out of this world, aircraft or beings that are in the possession of one of the governments on this earth, like the US government, is it possible? So the one perspective of that, if it's possible. Is it possible to keep a secret like that? I would say this, I think it's very highly possible because if you go if you just look at all the sightings and nuts, go just look at Project Blue. Look, it was what forget how many thousands of sightings. And there's a percentage it's like 10 or 15 percent. They still can't explain. Like our Tic-Tac is one of them. You know, they basically the government has come out and said, we don't know what that was. OK, so so if you go OK, of that 15 percent that we don't know and all of these thousands are still that 15 percent makes up a pretty big number, what are the chances that not one of them crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered? And I don't care if it's of intact system or you got pieces of it of a metal that we can't explain or some some biological matter, to say the least. It could be intact or it could, but the odds of that now are starting to go down that, you know, that could never happen. And I'm not talking just the United States. I'm talking the globally. So is there a chance that a foreign government actually possesses or our government or someone in the in the world on the globe of the seven plus billion people? Has something that is not from this world and I'm not talking a meteor, but something that was manufactured in some way that allowed transport or observation, could it be a drone? Could be a foreign drone. You know, like Voyager flies around and does all that stuff. And we got stuff that just went past Pluto that's out in the Kuiper Belt. You know, there's there's stuff out there floating around. And what about ours? It's going to crash into Jupiter eventually or whatever, because we've had stuff crashing into planets. So if that's the case, you would think something is out there that we have something that we can't explain. And according to LU, there is stuff that we can't explain. You know, and I would assume that Lu, who ran data, has has seen stuff that he can't openly talk about because, you know, because I had a clearance, when you have a clearance, you you sign your name, you're bound to that. And to me, that's an important oath that you hold to, you know, and this is kind of where, you know, people have issues with Bob. So if, you know, when I leave it to you to determine if you believe Bob and I'll tell you, Bob is a straightforward, very sane, normal, super smart guy. Are you? Yes. There is the other side that says, well, should he have come out and talked, you know, to those who will clearance, who, you know, are true to the government, you would say he should have never spoke. He he was under an oath to not say anything, but he did. If you asked Bob, why did you say something? His his answer was, I understand there's an oath, but I felt that the technology could benefit all of mankind and it shouldn't be locked away. Know I'll leave if you believe, Bob, that's that's kind of what Bob says. And that this is a really interesting point. If there is aircraft technology that's in the possession of the, say, the U.S. government, should they make that publicly known? This this node and this is the question of like, do we release stuff that can potentially change the nature of human civilization, like the the way we the way we think about our place in the world? Also, the if that technology is potentially useful for military applications, the nature of military conflict, should we release that information or not? If you were the government so. Well, here's exactly how so for for classified information, the government is the people that classify it. So I can't go I can't look at something and go, oh, my God, this Avión bottle is now top secret. I can't I don't have the authority, the ability or anyone to do that. That's up to the government. And I agree with that because I worked for the government for 24 years of my life. So I understand that. But now you go there's reason stuff is classified, OK? And it has to do with sometimes information is classified by how it was obtained. It's just like the mob. If I have a spy, I'm I'm a mobster and you're the counter mobster. But I have a guy on the inside that's feeding me information I can't do it in a perfect example is if you've ever seen the it's the Tom Cruise movie, what is it, Air America or whatever. But he he plays the guy in Louisiana who was hauling drugs for Pablo Escobar, and he ended up getting a cargo plane. And the government the CIA was kind of funding him to do stuff. That's how he got hooked up with Pablo. But they put cameras on his airplane. And when Reagan had come out and said, here's pictures, we have proof that they're running these drugs, it didn't take so long to figure out those pictures were taken from inside of the plane of this guy he had been working with. And that guy ends up dead. Does that make sense? So you classify to protect a source you classified to protect the technology, because if the technology would get out, it could be grave damage or there's levels depending on if it's a secret or top secret, there are levels of damage that can be done to the US government and our well-being as a country. And we owe it to this because we're all Americans. You know, to me, no matter what some people will say, even in this country, this is the greatest country on the planet. This is the only country that you have the ability to do what you want to do. It's just don't be lazy. And I have stories of people that came over here and started with nothing. And they're they're living the American dream. And they'll tell you. And they didn't get it because of, you know, I like you. You came over here from Russia. You get no minority status or anything else. You get you're a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, whatever your religion, you. But you come over here. I kind of knew that from the left. But you come over here, you basically have made yourself you're educated. You're working at literally the top research university in the world. To be honest, I can do whatever the hell I can create with a bit of with a lot of hard work. I can do quite a bit. No one gave it to you. So, I mean and I tell people I'm a believer that like that I mean, we are a community, so like there is a social aspect to it. But the freedom and the American dream is a real thing. And this is this I you know, I joke about being Russian, but I I'm an American and this is, I do believe, the greatest country on Earth. So there's a reason the nationalist pride, the pride in your nation is a powerful thing. And around that, this secrecy holds value. But to me, alien technology is bigger than that. I mean, it's it's not so much a threat as you're holding back something that could inspire the world like a human knowledge. So let's talk in theory. So I'm going to go back to Bob because I've talked about. So Bob is a propulsion guy, right? Right. Bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor. He built the rocket car, you know, so he did that. So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system, let's just say this is I'm just talking this is Dave's theory. Yeah, I am. I own I have I have custody of this thing from a technology that I don't understand. And I know it's a propulsion system. So now I got to figure it out. Right. So who are you going to go to? Right. You go find someone. So you go, wait. Here's a guy who at the time was working at Los Alamos, which they have proven who is big into propulsion. He designs all this. He builds a shit in his garage. Hey, he's super smart. Why don't we bring him in? So you hire him on a contract and you go, hey, we're going to brief you on the program. And he goes and works on wherever he says he worked. You know, that's not important. But you get access to the technology to try and figure it out. And then you go, well, you know, Bob comes out and says, you know, we're figuring out these things, but there's a part where our technology isn't advanced enough for us to figure the whole thing out. So then, you know, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out and tell anyone he he works on it until he gets to a point where he stagnated, he he's he's in a wall. You go, I can't do it. So sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind. So you go find someone else who's in a propulsion. You bring him and they work. They can't figure it out or they get to the point where kind of back to the Einstein theory where, hey, I've got all these theories on how it works, but we don't have the technology. We haven't advanced enough to actually do what we need. Do we still have to advanced technology more? So then what do you do yourself? You go, hey, good projects over and the contract yourself it and you wait another ten years and you wait another ten years until technology and our abilities and our our research advances more. And then you go find new people to bring in that are experts in that view and go, hey, we want you to work on this thing. And here's what we know about it so far. Or you don't tell him anything because because remember, if you if you reveal someone else's research, you can taint their beliefs. They'll start to sway in that direction. So you go, I'm not going to tell you anything. I'm going to give you this thing. And now you tell me what you think. And as they progress, if they get stuck on a problem that maybe Bob and someone else solved earlier, you can go, hey, what about this? You don't have to tell where it came from. What about this? And now they can leapfrog and they get another two steps closer to the final answer. And then we get stuck by our evolution of technology. Shove it again. Do you think that's the right way to do it? Because it's heartbreaking. I don't listen. I love government, but we just had this discussion about Elon and so on. The the alternative approach is to release this to the world and say there's a mystery here. And then the Ilan's of the world that Jeff Bezos we talked about money, but it's also not just money. It's like this engine that's within. We talked about the American dream to say I'm going to be the one that cracks this mystery open and like that's within a lot of us. And like money aside, people in their garage just will. But you're thinking like a scientist now. Let me know. Let's shift to let me think like a country. So we have country A, B and C, and you can look at the nuclear arms race. So we know that Germany was really close. We know that Russia was getting pretty close. We just won the race and we were the first ones with it. Yeah. And still to this day, Germany could have won the. They could have won. They could have won. But someone was smart enough to not finish the equation when they knew they had. The answer is literally what it comes down to. Someone was smart enough to realize if that that got into the hands of the Nazis, that that would be the end. And that's that's a tough call to do that, knowing that you have the answer and you can't solve the problem because it will go into the wrong end. And that's kind of the fear. When you look at this, you go, OK, so if we do this, if we put it out there, we've got this technology. If we don't work on it, kind of International Space Station, like we're all going to work on it together in a you know, like Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty free from any weapons or anything. We're supposing we got the international thing down there. We're all going to work together. If you did it in a in the confines of that and you could control the flow in and out because what you don't want is the someone stealing information and getting it back to where and countries are interest to do this. Hey, we're doing internationally, but we're secretly doing it ourselves to see who can come up with a solution first. That's the problem because we have this inherent thing of power and technology like that is power. It would literally change the game of the way the world operates and from not just a transportation or mankind, but from a military aspect. It's got huge, huge. Yeah, yeah. I as a beautifully, beautifully presented and there's I feel like there's a tension between those two place, the scientists view of the world and the national security view of the world. Let me get to this kind of interesting point, which is a lot of conspiracy theorists kind of paint a picture of government as an exceptionally as a hierarchical system that's exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets. And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe to almost any conspiracy theory to the degree at least that the conspiracy theorists do. I agree with you. But the there does seem to be and I tend to think of government as unfortunately incompetent, at least the bureaucracy. It seems that the communication, like the three videos that were released and just the way of Dodie's in general talks about the things we've been talking about is just confused. This contradictory. It's not inspiring. It's it's suspicious. It's just not even the way they released the videos. You know, the Tic-Tac, if presented correctly, could just inspire a generation of scientists. It's like at the US going to the moon. And it's inspiring. I mean, it's incredible, you know, and the way was really so suspicious. It was like low resolution video on a crappy web. Say, like with some crappy documents and I mean, why what? I don't know how to ask this question, but can government do better? Why are they doing it this way in terms of communicating the things they do know to the public? Because I don't think they know how. Now, especially in this topic, it's been hidden for so many years, and I don't think because I don't buy off on the conspiracy stuff, I just think that, you know, when it comes in, like I said, you know, the government has the right to classify stuff. They they classify everything because they don't know you have something. You don't know what it is you don't know. So we just go, well, it must be must be top secret and let's put it in a vault. You know, it's kind of like the Indiana Jones where they take the ark and they put it in the it's in the giant army warehouse, you know, and we don't even know what we have. So but I also believe that, you know, and I'll say this openly, I don't think that the American people need to know everything. I think there's a reason that stuff is classified for the protection of this country, and I totally believe in that. So, you know, I was joking with Joe when he was talking about a storm, Area 51, something like, yeah, that's probably the worst idea you could possibly have, is to just storm a military installation. It's just stupid. There are reasons. There are reasons that we have things that we don't just let out to the public, because if we do, as soon as you do, let someone know that you have something, they immediately try to counter it. And perfect example. The U.S. in the 60s developed a bomber, it was a mock three compressional bomber called the XB 70, OK, there was three of them built, three of them ever built. It was a like sixty thousand foot high mock three. They an incredible airplane. When you see it, there's actually the last one remaining is in Dayton, Ohio, at the museum. You know, it would go that wingtips would fold on it looks like a Concorde, but it's way faster. When that got out that we were developing it, the Soviet Union developed the MiG 25, literally a high altitude interceptor to counter that bomber, and they built an entire fleet of MIG. Twenty five. Right. We built three Zib 70s and we scrapped the program. Right. Because now you go, well, it's the technology is cool. We proved it, but now it becomes obsolete. So it's not even worth building a whole fleet of these things. You know, it's constant. It's a chess game. We do something. They do something, we do something. They do something. And it's we do something. And then they counter it. They got to you got to figure out how to defeat it. So you go out, we'll build something. So the more we keep quiet, especially from a defense standpoint, the better. We actually I personally think we talk too much. And I think the the military and the DOD is starting to see that, you know, we're too open. You know, you know, you announce, hey, we're building this because there's a budget line and we live in a free society. But you don't have to release all the specs and you don't have to put everything in open source. But that's a problem when we go to the universities, if we want to go do work with MIT and you want to partner with MIT and your defense company and you want to partner, you know, you guys have a rule that if you create it, then it can be open source because the university owns it. And we are an institution of learning where the defense side might go. We don't we don't really want that published in a paper in Scientific America or I break I talked to CTO of Lockheed Projects and just just skunkworks the some of the best, if not the best engineering and science. But engineering really ever is done in secrecy. And it sucks because it's so inspiring and they can't talk about it. It is. But still due to funding, the U.S. government has deep pockets. You know, some of this new technology that you developed for an open source, unless and this is goes back to the original conversation, we now there's enough money in the private sector that individuals control. Beezus, I'm not talking Amazon, I'm talking Jeff Bezos single individual worth over one hundred billion dollars, he has the ability to do stuff. I'll tell you what the Gates Foundation with between Bill Gates and his his wife and Warren Buffett and some of the other money, because I think Bezos, his ex-wife, actually donated a huge chunk of her half into the conversation. So, I mean, what's the Gates Foundation worth these days? You know, and these are guys, you know, brilliant, brilliant. I mean, some of the greatest minds we have to go, you know, what are they doing? Because they have the ability to it's a nonprofit thing. Hey, I want to fund this. I want to fund this research. They can look beyond the conflicts between nations. You can look beyond the conflict of having to have a classification. You could do what you want. You know, it's just like, you know, we classify how to do, you know, the whole nuclear you know, how to create critical mass. Right. But they're really smart high school kids that have figured out how to do it. They do their science project. And then the government comes in and says, hey, we got to classify your government because we just don't want this out in the public domain, which I understand. But they never stop them from free thought and developing that. It's just we really don't want this out there. OK, so I understand that. I totally understand it. But if they if Bill and Melinda want to do this and go, hey, we want to do this and they're going to work with Bezos and I'm going to work with Elon and we're going to think about it, there is a significant amount of money that could be available to R&D. And I'm not talking just science like this. I'm talking medical research and all this. But then you go, who gets it? Because now you're competing against the companies that actually do it. You go that well. Are they the greatest, greatest minds? I'd say, you know, we have a tendency to go. These are the best that we have. And I'd say, well, no, that's the best that we know we have. But there's probably people out there that don't want to work. There's brilliant minds that don't want to do anything with the fence because they just disagree with what it does. So they go to another path, they go do something else. And in the sense that the ilan's of the world, that Jeff Bezos actually, in a certain sense, much better than Dodie's at finding the brilliant, weird minds out there because they're not tied to the government. So when you work a government contract, the government writes, they tell you what they want and then they work with you on the requirements and they usually have an end in mean. You know, they have an idea that this is what I want it to be, where if you go to like Space X, where. You know, they come up with why don't we just land these things on a pad and reuse them? Yeah, well, if the government scientists, if you're on a government contract says no, that's not the requirements. We're not paying for that. We want you to do this. You're kind of controlled. Or when Elon does it, his company, they can do whatever the hell they want to do because they have no bounds. The only bounds they have is the liability if it doesn't work and it lands on something. So what do you do? You go out to Kwajalein and you test it. And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean, hey, we clean it up. No big deal. We lost the money, but we'll move on. It's money makes the world go round contrary to what everyone thinks. But, you know, there's a lot of money that's sitting around that you can do a lot of really cool stuff with. And I don't know. I mean, I'll guarantee that. What is it? Blue Origin? Isn't that Amazon? You know, that they're doing some cool stuff because they have funny and I joke with the guy I know that worked at SpaceX and he was funny because they were building the first test thing and they they were limited. And Elon found this like 400 acre thing. I think it's about 40 acres down by Waco, Texas. And he's like, I go, how he goes, he goes, Dude, I worked. He goes, I worked with. He goes because he's done government contract. He goes, there's a government contract. And then we're going to SpaceX with Elon money. And that's what he refers to it as, is Elon Money, where it was like, don't, I'll throw them. And he would throw the money at it and make it happen. And it's I'm talking this fast. Yeah. I mean, he talks about he has a great story about this. I mean, this is Elon and this is how fast you can do in the private sector via the government. Where there's the bureaucracy is they had a company that was a basically a tool and die machine shop that did a lot of their high precision parts for the rockets. They had went to the guy, but he had contracts with other companies. And when the economy was down, the guy was actually looking at going out of business. So the guy I know, he told me the story. He was talking to the guy. He had to go over there and get something. And he's like, holy shit. He goes, hang on. So he calls up on the phone space. He says, Hey, is Elon there? Can you get him in the boardroom? We'll be there in 20 minutes. So he grabs this guy who's literally going to fold his company. They go over to SpaceX and I may be getting some of this wrong if people are going to fact check me. But this is pretty close. They go in the boardroom and he said literally within like a, you know, an hour or two. Ian has bought the guys company, that guy is now a senior VP running the his company, and they're going to pull all the stuff into the SpaceX thing so they can actually build the parts and they can still contract out to make the money outside. And it happened like that fast. And it's not just money. It's because I see I witnessed it, too, with Elon. I think it's whatever whatever the forces of capitalism that allow a person like Elon Musk to rise to the top. But like because I've also worked for DARPA for research in terms of a source of funding, I there's a weight of bureaucracy. When I was working, like being funded by DARPA and with Elon, like I was literally in the presence of like anything is possible, cutting across all the bullshit of paperwork, of the way things were done in the past of the bureaucracy, the rules, the constraints, the all of that stuff, just you can cut across immediately. How much money and time do you waste dealing with the bureaucracy when you could actually be doing real work? That's the difference. And this is why I honestly, when I went back to the industrial defense complex that we were warned about, when you look at it and go, SpaceX can do something for half the price ahead of schedule that what Boeing were paying Boeing. And you go, oh, well, this just came out. You go, well, then why are we even dealing with this side when we can deal with this side? Because you've got a fully automated capsule that has a manual mode that they got to fly around in it, work like a champ. It went up. It hung out. It came back. It splashed down. It worked perfectly. You know, we're going to dust it off. And, oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules that were used and put to museums, they're going to reuse that dragon capsule came down. They're going to dust it off, put a new coat of paint on it, slapped on top of another rocket. Away it goes. Holy cow. It's amazing. It's a shift. It's a complete shift in mentality. And for us as taxpayers, we can explore at half the cost. Yeah, it's exciting, especially given the putting the Tic-Tac in context, like then the sky or it's limitless. The possibilities we could do with this kind of message. I think it's exciting. Yeah, I think we live in an exciting time right now besides everything that's messed up in the world right now. Well, this is this is a hopeful. Like, there's so much conflict going on, so much tension. That's to me, space exploration at the moment is a reason to get up in the morning and have a hope for the future to look up to the sky. And we're humans. We can solve so many. We can solve all of this. I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing, and I said is this would be great, you know, because when the government had come out a month ago and said, hey, this does exist, we're doing this and we're going to release more stuff. And I was texting like Lou and Chris Mullin and those guys before I went on because they had called me up to be on Tucker's show. And I'm like, I go, you know, this would be great. You know, just come out with the find the the the relic of a spaceship, like pull out the Roswell wreckage. If you have it, pull out the Roswell wreckage and do it. God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with the the riots in the cities. And I mean it. I know it's an election year and all that, but God, it would be something would be refreshing to not have to turn on my TV and see everything that is just depressing in the world to be here. Holy cow. We actually do have this and we're working on this technology. Imagine if there is a Rosewell aircraft and they pull it out. Imagine the innovation that happens in the next 10 to 20 years without any more information than that. Just the the innovation that happens. The look on the on Musks face, look on Jeff Bezos, his face and all the brilliant engineers would change the game. It would change. It would change the game completely. Let me ask the big question. I apologize for the absurd romantic nature of it outside. I mean, one of the things the fact that you've. Lay your eyes on a UFO. Probably open your eyes to the possibility that some of the other sightings. There could be other sightings that have legitimacy to them, what do you is the outside of your own sighting is the most interesting sighting or UFO related event in history? I think there's several what does it Rammasun Forest in England, the other guys that saw stuff and actually got radiation burns. One guy was medically disabled, but they weren't going to given and he had help from Jimmy Carter. John McCain, his office helped get the guy's disability re-established. I think that's a big one. I think there's people out there that have seen stuff. And I'm talking credible because there's you got to remember, there's a huge chunk of these sightings that get disproven. They're actually explainable. You know, you sent me the question, the the Phoenix lights. I think there's. What's that? Some say I'm not familiar with some of these. I'm not either. I want a funny story on it. So I was at a I was at a conference and hopefully he doesn't want us to get offended. But we had this this it was I call called speed dating. So there's a table of about eight people at a table. And we would go sit at the table and they could ask us questions. And then after ten minutes, we move to the next table. So speed dating all these people that are really into this. Yeah, I was kind of funny, but I sat down and it's not funny. So some people will try and dominate it. But, you know, you have to kind of push the Dominators away so that, you know, if you're quiet and introverted, you can ask your question here. So we got into this and the guy starts naming all these. Well, what about this? What about the Phoenix lights on my own about the Phoenix lights? What about this event? Oh, about that. He goes he looks at me and he goes, Well, you're not a UFO guy. Go, No, I'm not. But I chased one. So I'm an expert. Have you? And you could see you get deflated because I'm kind of a smartass like that. Yeah. I mean, the first hand experience from a credible in some sense, these sightings have to do both with the evidence and the human. Well, I think part of that is to us that's a credibility piece, because the four of us that actually saw it plus, you know, the other two that were in the airplane that shot the video, none of us are UFO obsessed people. So when we come out and say, because to me it's just in it's five minutes of my life, I did a lot of really cool and it really kind of neat things have been able to do. But when you look at it and go. We don't to me, it wasn't it's not the pinnacle of my life, you know, to other people that they live in the UFO world and it's like they you know, if you talk to people, they'll go that are really into it, who've never seen one. It kills them that they didn't see one when here we are because and what's unique with ours, which kind of adds that level, is it wasn't we just didn't see it. It wasn't like, oh, look, something in the sky. And it was weird. We actually engaged with it, you know. Yeah. Though there's an engaged five minute thing and there's other stories from other countries, like there's a story in the back when the Soviet Union existed that they actually would chase these things. And one of them shot at some, you know, it shot it because he said shoot at it and it shot it. And then it got shot down. And then he said, don't ever shoot at him again and don't chase them. Just you can observe them, but don't go after them because obviously they have firepower that we can't control, because if you can make something float around and jam radars at will and do whatever you want, you know, modern terrestrial weapons are probably not very useful. You know, you can go to Independence Day. They had that forcefield around. Oh, we got to. We got it. Now you got it. Cyber warfare. You got to take the bug down. You got to take the warfare. Now, we can actually inhibit some type of damage. So there's a I mean, you mentioned the Phoenix lights, somebody on. I think Rhetta said ask him any thoughts on mass UFO sightings like the Phoenix lights. So the interesting thing, like you said with the Tic-Tac, is that multiple people laid their eyes on this. What are your thoughts about the Phoenix? So many people. So here's a deal with massive sightings. So the Phoenix Lights is unexplainable, although I know the Air Force had said something about it was an eight ten drop and flares. No, I don't think so. Instead of flares, don't burn that long. They just come out and say, you know, they detract when they go away. Although on the other hand, there's, you know, because clouds can do things. So. So I lived in central California for 18 years and you would get oh, my God, what was that in the sky? And it was really Vandenberghe shooting a missile off. You know, they were doing ICBM tests at one time where they shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across and they go land in the atoll. It Kwajalein, you know, and then they can check the displacement, the accuracy and all that stuff, you know, stuff that we do because we were a superpower. But when you see them go up, you know, especially if you've ever watched a rocket really launch on a clear night, it'll have stream the glow and you can tell it's a rocket. But if you don't look up until later, when it starts to get to the outer edge of the atmosphere where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained, but you can watch us on TV when even the space X ones go. It's nice and narrow, narrow, narrow. And then it hits a point where it really starts to go up and it starts to come to the sides because there's the forces aren't holding that all into one unique thing. And it looks really odd and then it'll go off. Because it burns out and you get state separation, then you see the next one go off and then it's gone. And people don't understand it because they didn't watch it from launch because we sit in our driveway and, you know, if it was a three hour drive, but you could sit and watch it and I'd watch you watch. It's really cool if you don't see anything. What you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plume. You know what's left, the residue that's sitting in the atmosphere and the wind starts blown. So you get these really kind of weird shapes in the sky, you know, that's part. But when you go to Phoenix lights and you go, hey, you know, when a thousand people see something, are you going to discredit all a thousand people? Are you going to try and explain it away with something else? You know? You know, it's a weather balloon, you know, and it's a weather balloon. Again, just like the Tic-Tac, I think is just inspiring for the limitless nature of the science. I think you're I think more is going to come out, I think some of the stuff that the to the stars folks have done. So there's a 10 year academy. Yeah. What are your thoughts about them? Are they. I talked to them quite a bit. I am not a part of to the Stars Academy. I you know, but, you know, like I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this. What's their mission? What's their hope. What's there was there when they started their mission was to try and don't look at this as little green men. But let's look at this as a technology and let's try in almost reverse engineer and figure out how these things operate and how can we explain this from using our knowledge, you know, physics based knowledge to go how would something like this operate? That's really their bottom line, was to try and use and then couple that with because they've got the series Unidentified couple that with television to get the word out. So you're actually putting something instead of because everyone has a theory. You know, ancient aliens covers all kinds of theories. You know, it's kind of off of, oh, my God, and I've seen the stuff and I've seen stuff that I've said taken out of context on shows that I did not talk to. So there's all that because you can take a clip and go, oh, it's this. It's that, you know, and if I know about stuff like it, you can't technically use my likeness unless I tell you you can. So if I haven't signed something you can't do, there was a guy who put something out and I was in and I told him, you can take it down. And you talked to lawyers because I'm not I'm not supporting you. So they use it to tell some kind of narrative that it was connected to was let's face it, if you're making TV shows, there's two reasons to do it. One, you want to get word out, or two, you want to make money, or three, both. And so usually it's I would say the the make money is probably the biggest thing to put a TV show out. And the mission of the To the Stars Academy is to not do that is is to try to get some when I when I started and I talk to them because I've talked to Tom and I've talked to Lou and those are the two main players, it was to basically demystify the fact and get rid of the the stigma that's tied to UFOs. And let's look at it from a science base and then use TV to get the word out on the progress. And they've done some pretty cool things. I mean, you know, they've the the Italian government gave them all kinds of files that had been property. Their government, they got a bunch from it might have been Argentina gave them all kinds of stuff, like, here's all our records. What can you do with it to try and now pull from country based to a more global based research, which is what you were talking about, and then using independent scientists that are not tied to a government, I mean, any government, but just using independent research agencies to start looking at some of the metallurgy because you go, oh, I found this. We had this piece of metal. What is it in? Some of the stuff has been explained. They've got some objects, artifacts that have not been explained. And that's slowly coming out, you know, and I think and you hope as the US government, or at least some of the government is the government. The US government came out a month ago and said, we have we have we have material that we cannot explain the origin. They have said that they just haven't released the wreckage from the Roswell thing, which I keep joking about it like it's 70 some years old. I mean, they might let it out. I think you put it beautifully that in this time they'll will be a heck of an inspiring, hopeful thing to see. People don't just to distract them. Yeah, the division is I mean, nothing will unite as humans, descendants of chimps like the idea that there's life out there. Oh, it would literally change. I said this a while ago, I think, as the London Sun-Times had called me and I said, you know, personally, I think this is a global issue. It's not if there is stuff coming down, which we're pretty sure there is, there's enough stuff that we can't explain if there is stuff coming down. And this is not a country based thing and it's not about technology and it's not about who's going to win the next war because you don't know what they're doing. So you got really a couple of theories. One, you've got ETTY or Close Encounters, and the other extreme is you've got Independence Day. Are you going to prepare and bet on E.T. and Close Encounters or do you actually try and do stuff in case it is Independence Day? You actually have a game plan. And when you get into Independence Day, that scenario, you know, and I don't like going too much in the sci fi, but let's just say in theory that that becomes a reality. It's not a US, Russia, China, England, France, Spain name any country in any continent. It becomes a global issue. And the only way you can deny it, just like Americans, we all you know, we're divided. It's we it's been that way forever. So if you think we won't get through this, we'll get through it, because we've had times just like this before until Nazi Germany pops up in Nazi Germany, pops up or someone flies two airplanes into the World Trade Center, and then all of a sudden we're all like united. We also have very, very short memories. Yes, we do. Exactly. It's when you look and go, well, we can do this and you go, oh, no, no. If you think that everyone on the planet is good. You need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking, you know, we said that there were people during the rise of Hitler. No, no, it's OK. No, no, no, it's OK. We're not going to do. We're not going to stop. No, no, it's OK. No, no, it's OK. And you got to think the only thing that stopped Hitler was his ego by going into Russia. If he just stuck with the pact with Stalin and not went to the east and had a fight. And it was really the Russian winter that crushed him and he would have put all his high troops to the other side, there would have been a totally different outcome. The man in the iron, the man in the high tower, whatever the Netflix show or Nazi actually wins it. And you look, you know, we didn't know everything that was going on, especially the atrocities with the concentration camps and what he was doing to the Jews. I mean, it's you look at that going if you really want to see evil. And then there's the whole side of what Stalin did because he actually exterminated more people than Hitler did. But that never gets the press. And the thing is, we forget to forget this history in our conflicts today. We forget that there is the nature of evil. We forget that there's real evil in the world. And the thing to fight that evil is to be united, to be both. It's like this interesting line, like you talked about Joe Rogan of being both like kind to each other, compassionate, empathetic, but also being like strong and a bad motherfucker when you need to to make sure that you that there is a balance between kindness and force. That is, you use force when force is necessary. But you don't have to walk around like Billy Badass all the time. I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with that literally could kick the shit out of whoever came near them. They never got in fights because, one, even people that didn't know them because they were actually nice guys, you know, they were they're just good dudes. But, you know, if you cross them like I had a friend of mine, he was he's a nationally ranked wrestler. It went to went to Naval Academy with me. He's a very, very good friend of mine. And he is when you meet him and he wrestled at 190 ninety pounds. And he did not lose a match his senior year until he went to Nationals. He just had a bad day. He actually lost to a guy. He had pummeled the shit out of me and he would cross. It was funny. We joke about it even with him, because when you meet him, he's like the nicest, like local. Hey, hey, dude, you know. Hey, how are you doing? He's super nice. And he would cross that ring on on a wrestling mat as soon as he crossed that ring. It was like a totally different person and he would go out there and just destroy people. I mean, physically destroy, like put a hurt on and he would get done. And he's, like, super humble. And they'd raise his hand and he would he'd have this blank expression. They'd raise his hand and he'd walk off. And as soon as he crossed the line, he'd he'd look up. Hey. Hi, guys. How are you doing? Like, he literally just went could read someone's arms off, but as soon as he crossed a line, he was a totally different person. He's like and he's that way today. Yeah. I mean, he won't even tell you he's a wrestler. Yeah. That's kind of a symbol of the best of America. That's what America is. Oh, he's the wrestler. He's across the line. You're you're you can be hard, but once you're off the mat, you're just the kind of human being. Yeah, I know you're super humble. Saying it's better to be lucky than good, but your story is inspiring. That the entire trajectory of having a dream, of accomplishing that dream, of having one hell of a career. What advice would you give to a young person, to a young version of yourself today that listens to this and inspire that wants to fly or wants to go to space and wants to build the rocket? Is there advice you could give them about life, about career, about anything? Yeah. Yeah. First, let me start with you, and you had a question on inspirational people, so my grandfather, I had mentioned him earlier. Huge funeral beer delivery guy was delivering beer in the 60s. Riots were the guys in the black neighborhoods where, you know, white people didn't go. And my grandfather's Sicilian. He was one of the first ones in his family, born in the United States. So my great grandmother and I had aunts and uncles that I knew growing up that actually came over on the boat. Huge, huge guy. And just the nicest, friendliest would give you the shirt off his back, obviously proven by his funeral. And I'm talking at his funeral. The head of the Black Panthers was at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio. The Mafia guys were at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio. I mean, it was literally a mix of of of who's who. And he had told me once, you know, because when you're little, you start looking. And I grew up basically I was probably middle class, lower middle class. My dad was a fireman. You're not rich. He's working for the city. It was a paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up. And I was talking to my grandfather one day and he said something to me, and this is this is literally how I run my life. He said it was about money because you'd see, you know, back in the day if you saw someone in a Mercedes that was rare. You know, they were everywhere, you know, people that you couldn't leave the car. You actually bought a car and usually bought a car with cash. So it was a totally different than we are now. And he said he goes, you know, David, he goes there no better than you and you're no better than anyone else. He goes, you got to remember that. He goes, everyone's different. He goes, treat everyone with the respect and dignity that they deserve. He goes, and if they're poor, if they're homeless, he goes. It doesn't make him a bad person. It just that's that's who they chose to be. And you make choices in your life, but never, ever look down on someone because, you know, there will always be someone that will look down on you and you should never, ever do that. And I kept that close to me. He was a huge influence. Was my mom's dad just a big, big influence in my life and the way I carried myself. And he was one that would say, you know, you can be anything you want to be. You know, he grew up dirt poor, you know, in the fact that he had bought a house and took good care of my grandmother and did stuff like that. You know, to him that was a success. And to me, it was always, you know, trying to better and move on. And he was the one you know, my parents were a big part of this, too, was instilling that that anything is possible. So when I'm four years and 11 months old in 1969, you know, and I'm watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon and I'm asking my mom and she says, well, they were all military pilots. And, you know, we had an Air National Guard that at the time was flying F 100. So I'm dating myself. And I was just fascinated with flight. And I just looked that going, that's really what I want to do. And I never lost sight of that. There was always I could do this or do that. And when I was going to go to college before I enlisted in the Marine Corps, I was accepted into natural resources at Ohio State. And I'm like, if I can't fly, I'll go be a forest ranger because I wanted to hang out in one of those towers in Colorado and look for fires, because that's just I like that stuff. You know, it was that or be an oceanographer because I was fascinated with Jacques Cousteau and I actually that's my my undergrad degree. Is Jacques Cousteau so influenced our Neil Armstrong and Jacques Cousteau? I have an oceanography degree. I got an MBA from University of Houston. Go Cougars got to mention them. And and so you looking people go, what what are you going to do with that? And I said, you know, I got an oceanography degree because I got well, I'm going to sail on the ocean. So at least if the ship sinks, I'll know where I'm at. And that was kind of a running joke. And then and then there's these passions. And underneath it is the is the belief that you can be anything you want to. You can. You know, I told my kids this, you know, when they were young, you know, it was tough, especially for my son. So when it was about five, six year, we knew Nate was colorblind. You know, my my wife's brothers are both color blind. It's really color deprived, color blind. You see, black and white. He can't tell he has issues with greens, reds, browns. It's funny if you're ever around someone like that because. So what are you looking at? Goes right over there by the red thing. I'm like, what are you looking at? I go, this like, he had a hat on one day ago. Which one are you getting? The hat? A hat in his hand. It was green. He goes, I'm going to get the green one. I go, Oh, this one right. Here he goes, no, the one of my head. I go, Nate, that one's brown. He's like, Leave me alone, Dad. You got the brown hat. Because to him it looked great. Yeah. Yeah. So he couldn't fly. He came. He said, I go. Do you want to do any you know, you're talking to your kids and we want to go see I want to be a pilot now and I got to tell him because he's looking at me because I'm a pilot. Do you can't be a pilot. He's like, why can't I be a pilot? I said, because you got issues, you know? So you got to redirect. And the other one was because I had I stopped flying. I was forty two years old and I was like and it was my childhood dream. So it's like a pro athlete. I know exactly what it feels like when, you know, Brett Favre has to walk away from the NFL when you still can do it. Good choice of quarterback, by the way, the greatest of all time. But whatever. So you do and you look at it and you go, I understand what those guys feel like when you have to walk away from something you love and you think you can still do it. So I told them, I said, look, I was talking to both my kids and I said, you know, find something that you want to do, that you love to do and that you can do your whole life. And you should be able to do good things for other people, you want to be able to help other people. That's what I said. So both of my kids and there's no one in my family, both of my children, one of them is my daughter is a doctor doing a residency in internal medicine right now. And my son is in his third year and are both going to be doctors. And I look at it is, you know, people go, oh, you got to doctor. I don't care. I told my kids, if you want to be a garbage man or you want to dig ditches, I don't care. Just be be the best ditch digger that you can be, I said, and be happy doing it. Because what you also find is that we are in this big pursuit of money, money, money, money, money, money, money, and that's what makes the world go round. But what you realize and I'll go back to my grandfather who didn't have a lot of money, and he was probably one of the most happy people on life. And unfortunately, he died and he died at sixty five, had a massive heart attack because he didn't tell that he kind of knew what was happening and he just made the choice to to do and it was devastating to the entire family. But he didn't he didn't have a lot of money. But I'll tell you what, I know a lot of rich people who have funerals and there's nobody at them. And my grandfather, who's a beer delivery guy, had I it literally it was like three miles along the pope. It was crazy who died. That was because it was like he's a Catholic, he's Italian. He goes, you know who died? The Pope. And I got to ask my grandfather. And then the next funeral I went to was my aunt, his sister. And there was like, you know, thirty people. And I looked at my mother and I said, Where's everybody? And she goes, Oh. No, this is normal, this is what a normal funeral looks like, so it's, you know, for young kids, bottom line one, be nice, kindness will get you. I'm a big believer in karma. Kindness will get you a long way in the world. You know, it's easy. It's easy to be nice. It doesn't cost you anything. I said, you know, and get rid of the hate. And number two is follow your dreams because everyone is capable of everything. And there's a there's a self realism like, you know, if you really have trouble with math, getting a Ph.D. in applied math is probably not something you're going to be able to do. But understand yourself what your own capabilities are and, you know, inside your heart, don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do. You have to determine that yourself and go for it. And and you can do anything. It's just it's it's a great the world's incredible. It really is. Let me ask the last. Yeah. Big ridiculous question. So you've lived much of your life, your career is kind of at the edge of life and death. So let me ask kind of several different ways, the same kind of question. One, do you have you pondered your own mortality, the finiteness of it? And the bigger question to ask, even in the context of your Tic-Tac encounter, is what do you think is the meaning of this thing we've got going on here, the meaning of life, human life in this sense? So let me start with have I pondered my own mortality? Yes, quite often, and I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am, but I will tell you that I do believe in God. I've just seen too many things in the world that I can't explain and some people will explain it by subconscious. I'll give you a story in this kind of puts in the thing of do I fear death? So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with. We were stationed in Japan together and in Japan had this incinerator that put all kinds of dioxins. So there's a real high cancer rate for those that served on the base in Atsugi, Japan. Him and his wife had one son and their son passed away just before his 18th birthday of cancer. And I was hanging out with I'll call him John and I was hanging out with John, we were in oil and gas. He had come to the same company and we were doing an event together. And he was opening up to me because we were actually the demo pilots. We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff. And him and I were sitting there talking and. He was giving me the whole story and how he had really changed his look on life, that we're only here for a finite time and that we're all going to die. Well, unfortunately, after all that, when it was really going, him and his wife had moved to a location that fit there, you know, close to the water where they could do stuff. And I won't say where. And he was doing what he loved to do. And he got diagnosed with throat cancer. And I was talking to him is about maybe two months before he died. And I said. Dude, you're sad, you mean this is your friend and I'm kind of really bummed out and this is the guy this is a guy that's dying of cancer. And here's what he tells me. He says, Dave, dude, we're all going to die. He goes, but I have to look at it, I have to make the best of the time that I have and I said, I understand that. And he goes, with the exception of not being with my wife, who he loved dearly. He goes, I'm OK with dying. I've had a really good life. And. About because actually the original announcement when he when he finally passed away, a buddy of mine called me because I don't do Facebook and his wife had put it on Facebook that he had passed and about the day before he died, for some reason, I was thinking about him. And I had a dream where I think it was a dream or an altered reality, you can get into whatever, but he was there. It was just him and I. And I was really sad in the dream, I was actually crying and he was there and he was actually in his uniform using his white skin because he's a Navy. And we were just talking and he looked at me and he said, and this is in my dream, he's like, Dave, it's all going to be OK. And this is this is like and this is a vivid conversation. I have this and people don't think I'm weird about this, but, you know, I know what my dream was and, you know, maybe it's my subconscious creating the dream. But in reality, to me, this was real, that it was put there for a reason. He's and he basically explained everything, that's OK. I'm going to be fine. My wife is fine. He goes, this is this is what's meant to be, you know. But, you know, in the bottom line was make use of every day that you have because you don't know. And literally two days later, I find out that he passed. So but ultimately he accepted the finiteness of it. He did what you have to do. And it's like I talk about, you know, money and job position and this and that. And I said, you can get an any you know, you can go to a company. Just remember, when you want to be a VP of a company, you sell your soul to the company. You have to. I said, if you look, I joke with people at work. And I said I said, you know, when you ever think that you're important or this guy has that. I said, when you're sitting on ninety three or ninety five, one twenty eight and you're sitting in traffic and we're stop, which doesn't happen right now because of it. But normally it starts bumper to bumper and you're sitting here like I was coming down here by the gas tank. When you're sitting there, look left and look right, you know, and there can be a a Lamborghini or an S five Mercedes. And on the other side, there could be some piece of crap car. We're all sitting on the same freeway at the same time trying to do the same thing, which is just get home so we can be with our family. Because the most important thing that we have, it ain't money. And in our job, it's not our position. I go because when it's all said and done, you could be you know, you can be with the exception of the presidents of the United States, I mean, name the vice presidents. Most people can, and eventually they're going to die or eventually you're going to see a statue of a guy from the seventeen hundreds in the Boston area and you're good to go. I don't even know who that guy was. Did he impact my life? He probably did. But eventually people forget. You realize what's important now. And the one thing that you have is your family and your close friends. And that's that's it. You can take all the money or everything else if you're down on your luck, you know who is going to be. We always joke who your true friends. It's the person while there's there's ones that I won't say, but, you know, hey, your broke down on a road in the middle of nowhere and it's three o'clock in the morning. Who are you going to call. Is going to get in their car without complaining and come and get you. And that's life. Those that is life that people you love. It's it's it's the people you truly care about. And contrary to I have, you know. Oh, my God, I got six thousand Facebook friends. You get about that many real friends that you can count on and that's it. Everything else doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't mean you don't be nice. I mean, have there's acquaintance friends that I'll do anything for and then come to my house and stuff. But then there's the people, you know, you know, like my cousins who are like my brothers that, you know, at a moment's notice, you know, when when my uncle passed away at a young age, you know, who lived literally right down the street from me and my cousin Chad and I got two brothers, sisters, fourteen of us. There's only two boys. There's three of us together. And we all grew up in the same neighborhood, same schools play football together. All that. I said if one of those, if rare Chad ever needs me, if something happens like when my uncle died, it wasn't it wasn't an issue. If I'm coming home, it's I'm book in the ticket. I don't give a shit what it costs because I will be there to be here with you. And then those two guys and my college roommate is another one that I'm very, very close with. You know. You know, if there's there's I have a handful of people that, you know, I will drop literally everything, even if my wife would be pissed at me at times she's like, seriously, I got I got to do it. And now she knows. And it's the same thing with her. I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life that if they really need her and she has to go, she would go and I would let her go. So given all that, I'm honored that you would come here and talk to me and take the time, David was one of the best conversations I've ever had. Thank you so much. It's a pretty long one. That's probably sets the record for the longest one. So I. I mean, I'm a loss of words. One of my favorite conversations. Thank you so much for talking to me. You're welcome.

#118 – Grant Sanderson: Math, Manim, Neural Networks & Teaching with 3Blue1Brown, The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson, his second time on the podcast, he's known to millions of people as the mind behind three Blue One Brown, a YouTube channel where he educates, inspires the world with the beauty and power of mathematics. Quick summary of the sponsors. Dollar Shave Club Door Dash and cash app click. The sponsor links in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast, especially for the two new sponsors, Dollar Shave Club and Door Dash. Let me say as a side note, I think that this pandemic challenge millions of educators to rethink how they teach, to rethink the nature of education. As people know, Grant is a master elucidates of mathematical concepts that may otherwise seem difficult or out of reach for students and curious minds. But he's also an inspiration to teachers, researchers and people who just enjoy sharing knowledge like me. For what it's worth, it's one thing to give a semester's worth of material lectures. It's another to extract from those lectures the most important, interesting, beautiful and difficult concepts and present them in a way that makes everything fall into place. That is the challenge that is worth taking on. My dream is to see more and more of my colleagues at MIT and world experts across the world summon their inner three blue one brown and create the canonical explainer videos on a topic that they know more than almost anyone else in the world. Amidst the political division, the economic pain, the psychological medical toll, the virus masterfully crafted educational content feels like one of the beacon of hope that we can hold on to.

I've been a member of Dollar Shave Club for over five years now and I actually signed up when I first heard about them on the Joe Rogan podcast and now we've come full circle. I feel like I've made it now that I can do a read for them, just like Joe did. And all those years ago, for the most part, I've just used the razor and the refills. But they encouraged me to try the shave butter, which I've never used before. So I did. And I love it. Not sure how the chemistry of it works out, but it's translucent somehow, which is a cool new experience.

I have so many memories of working late nights for deadline with a team of engineers and eventually taking a break to argue about which Jordache restaurant to order from and when the food came. Those moments of bonding, of exchanging ideas, of pausing to shift attention from the programs to the humans or special. These days, for a bit of time, I'm on my own, sadly, so I miss that camaraderie. But actually Doordarshan is still there for me. There's a million options that fit into my keto diet ways. Also, it's a great way to support restaurants in these challenging times. Once again, download a door dash app and enter collects to get five bucks off your delivery fees and your first order of fifteen dollars or more. Finally, this show is presented by Kashyap, the number one finance app in the App Store, when you get it, Use Collects podcast, catch up, lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar. It's one of the best design interfaces of an app that I've ever used to make. Good design is when everything's easy and natural. That design is when the app gets in the way. Is it because it's buggy? Because it tries too hard to be helpful? I'm looking at you, Clippy. Anyway, there's a big part of my brain and heart that loves to design things and also to appreciate great design by others. So again, if you get cash out from the App Store, Google Play and use called Legs podcast, you get ten dollars in cash. Apple also donate ten dollars to First, an organization that is helping to advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world. And now here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson. You've spoken about Richard Feynman as someone you admire. I think last time we spoke, we ran out of time, so I wanted to talk to you about him. Who is Richard Feynman to you and your eyes? What impact did he have on you? I mean, I think a ton of people like Feynman, he's probably it's a little bit cliched to say that you like Feynman, right? That's almost like when you don't know what to say about sports and you just point to the Super Bowl or something as something you enjoy watching. But I do actually think there's a layer to Feynman that, like, sits behind the iconography. One thing that just really struck me was this letter that he wrote to his wife two years after she died. So doing the Manhattan Project, she had polio. Tragically, she died. They were just young, madly in love. And, you know, the icon of Feynman is this almost this like mildly sexist, womanizing philanderer, at least on the personal side. But you read this letter and they can try to pull it up for you if I want. And it's just this absolutely heartfelt letter to his wife saying how much he loves her even though she's dead and kind of what she means to him, how no woman can ever measure up to her. And it shows you that the fine men that we've all seen in, like, surely you're joking is different from the fine men in reality. And I think the same kind of goes in his science where, you know, he kind of sometimes has this out of being this Ashok's character, like everyone else is coming in this with these fancy faluting formulas. But I'm just going to try to whittle it down to its essentials, which is so appealing because we love to see that kind of thing. But when you get into it like. What he was doing was actually quite deep, very much mathematical, that should go without saying, but I remember reading a book about Feynman in a cafe once and this woman looked at me and was like, I saw that it was about Feynman. She was like, Oh, I love him. I read, you're joking. And she started explaining to me how he was never really a math person. And I don't understand how that can possibly be a public perception about any physicist. But for whatever reason, that, like, worked into his or that he sort of shut off math in place of true science. The reality of it is he was deeply in love with math and was much more going in that direction and had a clicking point into seeing that physics was a way to realize that. And all the creativity that he could output in that direction was instead poured towards things like fundamental, not even fundamental theories, just emergent phenomena and everything like that. So. To answer your actual question, like what what I like about his way of going at things is this constant desire to reinvent it for himself. Like when he would consume papers, the way he'd describe it, he's he would start to see what problem he was trying to solve and then just try to solve it himself to get a sense of personal ownership and then from there see what others had done. Is that how you see problems yourself? Like, that's actually an interesting point when you first. Are inspired by a certain idea they maybe want to teach or visualize or just explore on your own. I'm sure you're captured by some possibility of magic of it. Do you read the work of others? Like do you go through the process? Do you try to rediscover everything yourself? So I think the things that I've learned best and have the deepest ownership of are the ones that have some element of rediscovery. The problem is that really slows you down. And this is for my part, it's actually a big fault. Like this is part of why I'm I'm not an active researcher. I'm not like at the depth of the field. A lot of other people are the stuff that I do there. And I try to learn it really well. Um, but other times you do need to get through it at a certain pace. You do need to get to a point of a problem you're trying to solve. So obviously you need to be well equipped to read things without that reinvention component and see how others have done it. But I think if you choose a few core building blocks along the way and you say, I'm really going to try to approach this before I see how this person went at it, I'm really going to try to approach it for myself. No matter what. You gain all sorts of articulable intuitions about that topic, which aren't going to be there. If you simply go through the proof, for example, you're going to be trying to come up with counterexamples. You're going to try to come up with intuitive examples, all sorts of things where you're populating your brain with data and the ones that you come up with are likely to be different than the one that the text comes up with. And that, like, lends it a different angle. So that aspect also slowed Feynman down in a lot of respects. I think there was a period when, like the rest of physics was running away from him. But insofar as got it, got him to where he was, I kind of resonate with that. I just I would I would be nowhere near it because I not like him at all. But it's like a state to aspire to, you know, just to telling. And a small point you made that you're not, quote unquote, active researcher. Do you hear swimming often in reasonably good depth about a lot of topics? Do you sometimes want to, like, dive deep at a certain moment and say, like, because you probably built up a hell of an amazing intuition about what is and isn't true within these worlds? Do you ever want to just dive in and see if you can discover something new? Yeah, I think one of my biggest regrets from undergrad is not having built better relationships with the professors I had there. And I think a big part of success in research is that element of like mentorship and like people giving you the kind of scaffolded problems to carry along from my own, like, goals. Right now, I feel like, um, I'm pretty good at exposing math to others and like, I want to continue doing that for my personal learning. I. Are you familiar with, like, the hedgehog fox dynamic? I think this was either the ancient Greeks came up with it or it was pretended to be something drawn from the ancient Greeks that I don't know who to point it to, but they probably Mark Twain. It is that you've got two types of people, or especially two types of researchers. There's the Fox that knows many different things and then the hedgehog that knows one thing very deeply. So like von Neumann would have been the fox. He's someone who knows many different things, just very foundational, a lot of different fields. Einstein would have been more of a hedgehog thinking really deeply about one particular thing, and both are very necessary for making progress. So between those two, I would definitely see myself as like the fox, where I'll try to get my powers in like a whole bunch of different things. And at the moment, I just think I don't know enough of anything to make a significant contribution to any of them. But I do see value in like having a decently deep understanding of a wide variety of things. Like most people who know computer science really deeply don't necessarily know physics very deeply, or many of the aspects like different fields in math, even let's say you have like an analytic number theory versus an algebraic number theory, like these two things end up being related to very different fields, like some of them more complex analysis, some of them more like algebraic geometry. And then when you just go out so far as to take those adjacent fields, place one, you know, PhD student into a seminar of another ones. They don't understand what the other one's saying at all. Like you take the complex analysis specialist inside the algebraic geometry seminar there is lost, as you or I would be. But I think going around it like trying to have some sense of what this big picture is, certainly has personal value for me. I don't know if I would ever make like new contributions in those fields, but I do think I could make new, like expositional contributions where there's kind of a notion of, uh, things that are known but haven't been explained very well. First of all, I think most people would agree your videos, your teaching, the way you see the world is fundamentally, often new, like you're creating something new. And it almost feels like research, even just like the visualizations, the multidimensional visualization we'll talk about. I mean, you're revealing something very interesting. That, yeah, just feels like research feels like science. He feels like the cutting edge of the very thing of which, like new ideas and new discoveries are made of. I do think you're being a little bit more generous than is necessarily. And I promise that's not even false humility, because I sometimes think when I research a video, I'll learn like 10 times as much as I need for the video itself. And it ends up feeling kind of elementary. So I have a sense of just how far away like the stuff that I cover is from the actual depth. I think that's natural, but I think that could also be a mathematics thing. I feel like in the machine learning world, you like two weeks and you feel like you've basically mastered in mathematics. It's like, well, everything is either trivial or impossible. And it's like a shockingly thin line between the two where you can find something that's totally impenetrable. And then after you get a feel for it's like, oh yeah, that whole that whole subject is actually trivial in some way. So maybe that's what goes on. Every researcher is just on the other end of that hump and it feels like it's so far away, but one step actually gets them there. What do you think about sort of Fineman's teaching style or another perspective of use of visualization? Well, his teaching style is interesting because people have described like the Feynman effect, where while you're watching his lectures or while you're reading his lectures, everything makes such perfect sense. So as an entertainment session, it's wonderful because it gives you this this intellectual satisfaction that you don't get from anywhere else that you like, finally understand it. But the fundamental fact is that you can't really recall what it is that gave you that insight. You know, even a week later. And this is this is true of a lot of books and a lot of lectures where the retention is never quite what we hope it is. So. There is a risk that the stuff that I do also fits that same bill where at best it's giving this kind of intellectual candy on, giving a glimpse of feeling like you understand something. But unless you do something active, like reinventing it yourself, like doing problems to solidify it, um, even things like space, repetition, memory, to just make sure that you have, like the building blocks of what do all the terms mean? Unless you're doing something like that, it's not actually going to stick. So the very same thing that's so admirable about Feynman's lectures, which is how damn satisfying they are to consume, might actually also reveal a little bit of the flaw that we should, as educators all look out for, which is that that does not correlate with long term learning. We'll talk about it a little bit. I think we've done some interactive stuff. And even in your videos, the awesome thing that Feynman couldn't do at the time is you could sense his programmed you can like, tinker like play with stuff. You could take this value and change it. You can like heroes, take the value of this variable and change it to build up an intuition, to move along a surface or to to change the shape of something. I think that's almost an equivalent of you doing it yourself. It's not quite there. But you as a viewer. Yeah. Do you think there's some value in that interactive element? Yeah. Well, so what's interesting is you're saying that and the videos are not interactive in the sense that there's a play button and a pause button and you could ask like, hey, while you're programming these things, why don't you program it into an interactive version, you know, make it a Jupiter notebook that people can play with, which I should do, and that would be better. I think the thing about interactive, though, is most people consuming them, um, just sort of consume what the author had in mind. And that's kind of what they want. Like, I have a ton of friends who make interactive explanations. And when you look into the analytics of how people use them, there's a small sliver that generally use it as a playground to have experiments. And maybe that small sliver is actually who you're targeting and the rest don't matter. But most people consume it just as a piece of, um, like well constructed literature that maybe you tweak with the example a little bit to see what it's getting at. But in that way, I do think like a video can get most of the benefits of the interactive, like the interactive app. As long as you make the interactive for yourself and you decide what the best narrative to spend is. Um, as a more concrete example, like my process with I made this video about Essaouira models for epidemics and it's like this agent based modeling thing where you tweak some things about how the epidemic spreads and you want to see how that affects its evolution. Um, my, my, uh, format for making that was very different than others were. Rather than scripting it ahead of time, I just made the playground and then I played a bunch and then I saw what stories that were to tell within that. Um, yeah, that's cool. So your video had that kind of structure. It had like five or six stories or whatever it was. And like it was basically, OK, here's a simulation, here's a model. What can we discover with this model? And here's five things I found after playing. Well, because the thing is a way that you could do that project is you make the model and then you put it out and you say, here's the thing for the world to play with, like come to my website where you interact with this thing and people did, like, sort of remake it in a JavaScript way so that you can go to that website and you can test your own hypotheses. But I think a meaningful part of the value to add is not just the technology, but to give the story around it as well. And like, that's kind of my job. It's not just to make the, uh, the visuals that someone will look at. It's to be the one to decide what's the interesting thing to walk through here. Um, and even though there's lots of other interesting parts that one could take, that can be kind of daunting when you're just sitting there in a sandbox and you're given this tool with like five different sliders and you're told to, like, play and discover things, it's like where do you do? What do you start? What are my hypotheses? What should I be asking? Like, a little bit of guidance in that direction can be what actually sparks curiosity to make someone want to imagine more about it. A few videos I think you do. I don't know how often you do it, but there's almost a tangential, like pause where you here's a cool thing. You say like here's a cool thing, but it's outside the scope of this video, essentially. But I'll leave it to you as homework essentially to like figure out it's a cool thing to explore. I wish I could say that wasn't a function of laziness. Right. And it's like you've worked so hard on making the twenty minutes already that to extend it out even further, it would take more time. And one of your cooler videos, the Homma Morphic, like from the Mobius strip to the really described rectangle. Yeah, that's a super. And you're like, yeah, well, you can't you can't transform the the Mobius strip into, uh, into a surface without intersecting itself. But I'll leave it to you to to see why that is. Well I hope that's not exactly how it is, because I think it was my hope. Would be is that I leave it to you to think about why you would expect that to be true and then to want to know what. Aspects of them will be. Do you want to formalize such that you can prove that intuition that you have? Because at some point now you're starting to invent algebraic topology. If you have these vague instincts, like I want to get this Mobius strip, I want to fit it such that it's all above the plane, but it's boundary sits exactly on the plane. I don't think I can do that without crossing itself, but that feels really vague. How do I formalize it? And as you starting to formalize that, that's what it's going to get you to try to come up with a definition for what it means to be Oriental or not Oriental. And like once you have that motivation, a lot of the otherwise arbitrary things that are sitting at the very beginning of a topologies textbook start to make a little more sense. Yeah, and I mean that that whole video beautifully was a motivation for topologies core. That was my my hope with that is I feel like topologies. I don't want to say it's taught wrong, but I do think sometimes it popularized in the wrong way where, you know, you'll hear these things of people saying, oh, topologies, they're very interested in surfaces that you can bend and stretch, but you can't cut or glue, are they? Why? Well, yeah, there's all sorts of things you can be interested in with random, like imaginative manipulations of things. Is that really what like mathematicians are into? And the short answer is not not really. That's it's not as if someone was sitting there thinking, like, I wonder what the properties of clay are. They had some arbitrary rules about what when I can't cut it and when I can't glue it. Instead, it's there's a ton of pieces of math that can actually be equivalent to, like these very general structures. That's like geometry, except you don't have exact distances. You just want to maintain a notion of closeness. And once you get it to those general structures, constructing mappings between them translate into non-trivial facts about other parts of math. And that I just I don't think that's actually popularized. I don't even think it's emphasized well enough when you're starting to take a topology class because you kind of have these two problems. It's like either it's too squishy. You're just talking about coffee mugs and donuts or it's a little bit too Reger first. And you're talking about the axiom systems with open sets and open set is not the opposite of closed set. So sorry about that, everyone. We have a notion of open sets for ones that are both at the same time and just it's not it's not an intuitive axiom system in comparison to other fields of math. So you as the student like really have to walk through mud to get there. And you're constantly confused about how this relates to the beautiful things about coffee mugs and Mobius strips and such. And it takes a really long time to actually see like see topology in the way that mathematicians see apology. But I don't think it needs to take that time. I think there's, um, this is making me feel like I need to make more videos on the topic, because I think of what you do. But I've also seen it in my narrow view of like I find game theory very beautiful. And I know topology has been used elegantly to prove things in game theory. Yeah. You have like facts that seem very strange. Like I could tell you, you stir your coffee and after you stir it and like, let's say all the molecules settle to, like, not moving again, one of the molecules will be basically in the same position it was before. You have all sorts of fixed point theorems like this. Right. That kind of fixed point theorem, directly relevant tinashe equilibriums. Right. So you can imagine popularising it by describing the coffee fact, but then you're left to wonder, like, who cares about if a molecule of coffee, like, stays in the same spot? Is this what we're paying our mathematicians for? You have this very elegant mapping onto economics in a way that's very concrete, very I wouldn't say concrete, very tangible, like actually add value to people's lives through the predictions that it makes. But that line isn't always drawn because you have to get a little bit technical in order to. Properly draw that line out and often, I think, popularized forms of media just shy away from being a little too technical for sure. By the way, for people who are watching the video, I do not condone the message and the smug feeling, which is this. The snaggle is real, by the way, for anyone watching. I do condone the message of the struggles of snaggle Israel. OK, so you mentioned the Sahara model. I think there are certain ideas there of growth, of exponential growth, what? Maybe have you learned about pandemics from from making that video because it was kind of exploratory? We're kind of building up an intuition and it's again, people should watch the video. It's kind of an abstract view. It's not really modeling in detail the whole field of epidemiology. Those people, they go really far in terms of modeling, like how people move about. I don't know if you've seen it, but like there is the mobility patterns, like how like to think how many people you encounter in certain situations when you go to school, when you go to a mall, they like model every aspect of their four particular state, like they have maps of actual city streets. They model it really well and natural patterns of the people have it's crazy. So you don't do any of that is just doing an abstract model to explore different ideas of simple. Well, because I don't want to pretend like anybody. I'm an epidemiologist like we have a ton of armchair epidemiologists and the spirit of that was more like I can we threw a little bit of play, draw like reasonable ish conclusions and also just like get ourselves in a position where we can judge the validity of a model. Like, I think people should look at that and they should criticize it. They should point to all the ways that it's wrong because it's definitely naive, right in the way that it's set up. But to say, like what what lessons from that whole like thinking about the are non-value and what that represents and what it can imply are not so are not is if you are infectious and you're in a population which is completely susceptible, what's the average number of people that you're going to infect during your infectiousness? So certainly during the beginning of an epidemic, this basically gives you kind of the the exponential growth rate. Like if every person infects two others, you've got that one two four eight exponential growth pattern as it goes on. And let's say it's something endemic where you've got like a ton of people who have had it and are recovered, then you would the are not value doesn't tell you that as directly because a lot of the people you interact with aren't susceptible. But in the early phases it does. And this is like the fundamental constant that it seems like epidemiologists look at. And, you know, the whole goal is to get that down. If you can get it below one, then it's no longer epidemic. If it's equal to one, then it's endemic and it's above one, then your epidemic. So, like just hitting what that value is and giving some intuitions on how do certain changes in behavior change that value? And then what does that imply for exponential growth? I think those are general enough lessons and they're like resilient to all of the chaos of the world that it's still valid to take from the video. I mean, one of the interesting aspects of that is just exponential growth. And we think about growth that one of the first times you've done a video and on. No, of course not. The whole Euler's identity. OK, so I'm sure I've done a lot of videos about exponential growth in the circular direction, only minimal in the normal direction. I mean, another way to ask, like, do you think we're able to reason intuitively about exponential growth? It's funny, I think it's I think it's extremely intuitive to humans and then we train it out of ourselves such that it's then really not intuitive. And then I think it can become intuitive again when you study a technical field. So what I mean by that is, have you ever heard of these studies where in a like anthropological setting where you're studying a group that has been disassociated from a lot of like modern society and you ask what number is between one and nine, then maybe you would ask it. You've got like one rock and you've got nine rocks. You're like, what pile is halfway in between these? And our instinct is usually to say five. That's the number that sits right between one and nine. But sometimes when numeracy and the kind of just basic arithmetic that we have isn't in a society, the natural instinct is three because it's in between in an exponential sense and a geometric sense that one is three times bigger and then the next one is three times bigger than that. So it's like what's you know, if you have one friend versus one hundred friends, what's in between that? Yeah, ten friends. Seems like the social status in between those two states. So that's like deeply intuitive to us to think logarithmically like that. Um, and for some reason we kind of train it out of ourselves to start thinking linearly about things. So in the sense that early, early, basic math is it forces us to take a step back. It's the same criticism if there's any if science is the lessons of science. Make us like see the world in a slightly narrow sense to where we. We have an overexaggerated confidence that we understand everything as opposed to just understanding a small slice of it. But I think that probably only really goes for small numbers, because the real counterintuitive thing about exponential growth is like as the numbers start to get big. So I bet if you took that same set up and you ask them, oh, if I keep tripling the size of this RockPile, you know, seven times, how big will it be? I bet it would be surprisingly big even to like a society without numeracy. And that's the side of it that I think is pretty counterintuitive to us. But that you can basically train into people like, I think computer scientists and physicists when they're looking at the early numbers of like covid were they were the ones thinking like, oh, God, this is following an exact exponential curve. Yeah. And I heard that from a number of people. So it's an almost all of them are like techies in some capacity, probably just because I live in the Bay Area. But but for sure, they're cognizant of this kind of this kind of growth as president. A lot of natural systems and a lot of in a lot of. And a lot of systems, I don't know if you seen like I mean, there's a lot of ways to visualize this, obviously, but Ray Kurzweil, I think, was the one that had this, like, chess board. Where every every square on the chessboard, you double the number of stones or something in that chessboard over this is like an old proverb where it's like, you know, someone the king offered him a gift and he said, the only gift I would like, very modest, give me a single grain of rice rice. So this is a chessboard. And then two grains of rice for the next square, then twice that for the next square and just continue on. That's my only modest ask yourself. And like, you know, more grains of rice than there are anything in the world. By the time you get to the end and I, I, my intuition falls apart there, like I would have never predicted that. Like, for some reason, that's a really compelling illustration of how poorly breaks down. Just like you said, maybe we're OK for the first few piles of rocks, but after a while it's game over. You know, the other classic example for gauging someone's intuitive understanding of exponential growth is I've got like a lily pad on unlink, really big lake like Lake Michigan. And that lily pad replicates it doubles one day and then it doubles the next day and the next day. And after 50 days, it actually is going to cover the entire lake. Okay, so after how many days does it cover? Half the lake. Forty nine. So you have a good instinct for exponential growth. So I think a lot of like the knee jerk reaction is sometimes to think that it's like half the amount of time or at least be like surprised that like after 49 days you've only covered half of it. Yeah. I mean, that's the reason you heard a pause for me. I literally thought that can't be right. Right. Yeah, exactly. So even when you know the fact and you do the decision, it's like, wow. So you've gotten like that whole time. And then before nine it's only covering half. And then after that it gets the whole thing. But I think you can make that even more visceral if rather than going one day before you say how long until it's covered one percent of the lake. Right. And it's so what would that be? Um, how many times you have to double take it over? A hundred, like seven, six and a half times. Something like that. So at that point you're looking at 43, 44 days into it. You're not even at one percent of the lake. So you've experienced, you know, 44 out of 50 days. And you're the guy that lilypad it's just one percent of the lake. But then next thing you know, it's the entire lake. He wearing a space x shirt, so I'm sure let me ask you, one person who talks about exponential, you know, just the miracle of the exponential function in general. Elon Musk. So he kind of advocates the idea of exponential thinking, you know, realizing that technological development can, at least in the short term, follow exponential improvement, which breaks apart our intuition, our ability to reason about what isn't isn't impossible. So he's a big one. It's a good leadership kind of style of saying, like, look, the thing that everyone thinks is impossible is actually possible because exponential. But what's your sense about about that kind of we see the world. Well, so I think it's it can be very inspiring to note when something like Moore's Law is another great example where you have this exponential pattern that holds shockingly well and it enables just better lives to be led. I think the people who took Moore's Law seriously in the 60s, we're seeing that, wow, it's not going to be too long before, like these giant computers that are either batch processing or time shared, you could actually have one small enough to put on your desk on top of your desk and you could do things. And if they took it seriously, like you have people predicting smartphones, like a long time ago, and it's only out of, like kind of this. I don't want to say faith in exponential, but an understanding that that's what's happening. What's more interesting, I think, is to really understand why exponential growth happens and that the mechanism behind it is when the rate of change is proportional to the thing in and of itself. So the reason the technology would grow exponentially is only going to be if the rate of progress is proportional to the amount that you have so that the software you write enables you to write more software. And I think we see this with the Internet, like the advent of the Internet makes it faster to learn things, which makes it faster to create new things. Um, I think this is oftentimes why, like investment will grow exponentially, that the more resources a company has, if it knows how to use them well, the more the more it can actually grow. So, I mean, you know, you referenced Elon Musk. I think he seems to really be into vertically integrating his companies. I think a big part of that is because you have the sense what you want is to make sure that the things that you develop, you have ownership of in that they enable further development of the adjacent parts. Right. So it's not just this. You see a curve and you're blindly drawing a line through it. What's much more interesting is to ask when do you have this proportional growth property? Because then you can also recognize when it breaks down, like in an epidemic, as you approach saturation that would break down, as you do anything that skews what that proportionality constant is, you can make it maybe not break down as being an exponential, but it can seriously slow at that exponential rate is the opposite of a pandemic is you want well, in terms of ideas, you want to minimize barriers that prevent the spread. You want to maximize the spread of impact. So like you want it to grow when you're doing technological development is so that you do hold up, that rate holds up. And that's that's almost like a like an operational challenge of like how you run a company, how you run a group of people, is that any one invention has a ripple that's unstopped. And that ripple effect then has its own ripple effects and so on. And that continues. Yeah, like Moore's Law is fascinating. And that like on a psychological level. On a human level, because it's not exponential, it's it's just a consistent set of like what you call like askers, which is like it's constantly like breakthrough innovations non-stop. That's a good point. Like it might not actually be an example of exponential because of something which grows in proportion to itself, but instead it's almost like a benchmark that was set out that everyone's been pressured to meet. And it's like all these innovations in micro inventions along the way, rather than some consistent sit back and just let the lilypad grow across the lake phenomenon. And it's also that there's a human psychological level for sure of like the four minute mile, like there's something about it like saying that, look, there is you know, Moore's Law is the law. So, like, it's it's certainly an achievable thing. You know, we achieved it for the last decade, the last two decades, last three decades. You just keep going and it somehow makes it happen. And it makes people I'm continually surprised in this world how few people do the best work in the world, like in that particular whatever their field is. I guess very often that like the genius. I mean, you could argue that community matters, but it's certain, like I've been in groups of engineers were like. One person is clearly like doing an incredible amount of work and just is the genius and it's fascinating to see basically it's kind of the Steve Jobs idea is maybe the whole point is to create an atmosphere where the genius can discover themselves like like have the opportunity to do the best work of their life. And. Yeah, and that the exponential is just milking. That is like replacing the idea that it's possible. And that idea that it's possible finds the right people for the four minute mile Najia that is possible, finds the right runners to run it and then explodes the number of people who can run faster than four minutes. It's kind of interesting to I don't know, basically the positive way to see that is most of us are way more intelligent, have way more potential than we ever realize because it's kind of depressing. But I mean, like the ceiling for most of us is much higher than we ever realize. That is true. A good book to read, if you want. That sense is peak, which essentially talks about peak performance and a lot of different ways, like, you know, chess, London cab drivers, how many push ups people can do, short term memory tasks. And if there's one, it's meant to be like a concrete manifesto about deliberate practice and such. But the one sensation you come out with is, wow, no matter how good people are at something, they can get better and like way better than we think they could. I don't know if that's actually related to exponential growth, but I do think it's a true phenomenon. It's interesting. Yeah. I mean, there's certainly no law of exponential growth in human innovation. Well, I don't know what kind of there is. Like, there's I think it's really interesting to see when innovations in one field allow for innovations and another like the advent of computing seems like a prerequisite for the advent of chaos theory. You have this truth about physics and the world that in theory could be known. You could find Lorenz's equations without computers, but in practice, it was just never going to be analyzed that way unless you were doing like a bunch of simulations and that you could computationally see these models. So it's like physics allowed for computers, computers allowed for better physics and, you know, wash, rinse and repeat that. So proportionality, that's exponential. So I think I wouldn't think it's too far to say that that's a law of some kind. Yeah, a fundamental law of the universe is that these descendants of apes will exponentially improve their technology in one day to be taken over by the Ajai. That's that's built in this. They'll make the video game fun, whoever created this thing. I mean, since you're wearing a space shirt in the mask, I didn't realize it, but I apologize for you. That's on top. Yeah. So could Dragon, the first crewed mission out into space since the space shuttle and just. By first time ever by a commercial company, I mean, it's an incredible accomplishment, I think, but it's also just an incredible and it inspires imagination amongst people that this is the first step in a long, vibrant journey of humans into space. Oh, yeah. So what what are your how do you feel? Is this is this exciting to you? Yeah, it is. I think it's great the idea of seeing it basically done by smaller entities instead of by governments. I mean, it's a it's a heavy collaboration between SpaceX and NASA in this case, but moving in the direction of not necessarily requiring an entire country and its government to make it happen, but that you can have something closer to a single company doing it. We're not there yet because it's not like they're unilaterally saying like we're just shooting people up into space. Um, it's just a sign that we're able to do more powerful things with smaller groups of people. Uh, I find that inspiring. And very quickly, I hope we see people land on Mars in my lifetime. Do you think we will? I think so. And I think there's a ton of challenges there, like radiation being kind of the biggest one. And I think there's a ton of people who look at that and say, why? Why would you want to do that? Let's let the robots do the science for us. But I think there's enough people who are, like, genuinely inspired about broadening, like, the worlds that we've touched, um, or people who think about things like backing up the light of consciousness with like super long term visions of terraforming, like as long as there's a backing up the light of consciousness. Yeah. The thought that, you know, if we if Earth goes to hell, we got to have a back up somewhere. Um, a lot of people see that is pretty out there and it's like not in the short term future, but I think that's an inspiring thought. I think that's a reason to look it up in the morning. And I feel like most employees at SpaceX feel that way, too. Do you think we'll colonize Mars one day? No idea like either ajai kills us first or if we like, allowed, I don't know if it'll take allowed allowed like honestly it takes it would take such a long time, like, OK, you might have a small colony. Right. Something like what you see in the Martian, but not like people living comfortably there. Um, but if you want to talk about actual like second earth kind of stuff, that's just like way far out there and the future moves so fast that it's hard to predict, like we might just kill ourselves before that even becomes viable. I yeah. I mean, there's there's a lot of possibilities where it could be just it doesn't have to be on a planet or it could be floating out in space, have to have have a have a space faring backup solution that doesn't have the doesn't have to deal with the constraints of the planet. I mean, a planet provides a lot of possibilities and resources, but also some constraints now. I mean, for me, for some reason, it's deeply exciting possibility. Oh yeah. And all of the people who are like skeptical about it are like, why? Why do we care about going to Mars? Like, what makes you care about anything backfiring? It's hard, actually. It is hard to hear that because exactly as you put it on a philosophical level, it's hard to say why do anything? I don't know. It's it's like the people say like. Oh, you know, I've been doing like an insane challenge last 30 something days, you pull ups and pull ups and push ups and like. You know, a bunch of people are like, awesome, you're insane, but awesome. And then some people are like, why? Why I do anything? I don't know. There's there's a calling. It's I'm with JFK a little bit as because we do these things because they're hard. There's something in the human spirit that is like saying, what, like a math problem? There's something you fail once. And it's like this feeling that, you know, I'm not going to back down from this. There's something to be discovered in overcoming this thing. Well, what I like about it is and I also like this about the moon missions. Sure. It's kind of arbitrary, but you can't move the target, so you can't make it easier and say that you've accomplished the goal. And when that happens, it just demands actual innovation. Right. Like protecting humans from the radiation in space on the flight there. While their hard problem demands innovation, you can't move the goalpost to make that easier. Almost certainly the innovations required for things like that will be relevant in a bunch of other domains, too. So like the idea of doing something merely because it's hard, it's like loosley, productive, great. But as long as you can't move the goalposts, there's probably going to be these secondary benefits that like we should all strive for. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to formulate the Mars colonization problem as something that has a deadline, which is the problem. But if there was a deadline, then the amount of things we would come up with by forcing ourselves to figure out how to colonize that place would be just incredible. This is what people like. The Internet didn't get created because people sat down and try to figure out how do I have, you know, send Tic-Tac videos of myself dancing to people. They you know, it was there's an application. I mean, actually, I don't even know. What do you think the application for the Internet was when it was? It must have been very low level basic network communication within DARBA, like a military base, like how do I send like a networking? How do I send information securely between two places? Maybe it was an encryption until totally speaking totally outside of my knowledge, but like it was probably intended for a very narrow small group of people. Well so I mean it was there was like the small community of people who are really interested in timesharing computing and like interactive computing in contrast with batch processing. And then the idea that as you set up like a timesharing center, basically meaning kind of multiple people like logged in and using that like central computer, why not make it accessible to others? And this was kind of what I had always thought, like, oh, is this like fringe group that was interested in this new kind of computing? And they all like got themselves together. But the thing is, like, DARPA wouldn't actually you wouldn't have the U.S. government funding that just for the fun of it. Right. But in some sense, that's what ARPA was all about, was like just really advanced research for the sake of having advanced research. And it doesn't have to pay out with utility soon. But the core parts of its development were happening like in the middle of the Vietnam War when there was budgetary constraints all over the place. I only learned this recently, actually. Like if you look at the documents basically justifying the budget for the ARPANET as they were developing it and not just keeping it where it was, but actively growing it while all sorts of other departments were having their funding cut because of the war. A big part of it was national defense in terms of having like a more robust communication system, like the idea of packet switching versus circuit switching. You could kind of make this case that in some calamitous circumstance where, you know, a central location gets nuked, this is a this is a much more resilient way to still have your communication lines that, like traditional telephone lines, weren't as resilient to which I just found very interesting that that, um, even something that we see is so happy. Go Lucky is just a bunch of computer nerds trying to get like interactive computing out there. The actual, like thing that made it funded and thing that made it advance when it did was because of this direct national security question and concern. I don't know if you've read it. I haven't read it. I've been meaning to read it. But Neil deGrasse Tyson actually came out with a book that talks about, like science in the context of the military, like basically saying all the great science we've done and in the 20th century was like because of the military. I mean, he paints a positive. It's not like a critical. It's not a lot of people say like military industrial complex and so on. Another way to see the military and national security is like a source of, like you said, deadlines and like hard things. You can't move like almost, you know, almost like scaring ourselves into product. It is that I mean, the Manhattan Project is a perfect example, probably the quintessential example that one is a little bit more McJob than others because of like what they were building. But in terms of. How many focused, smart hours of human intelligence get pointed towards a topic per day, you're just maxing it out with that sense of worry. In that context, everyone there was saying, like, we've got to get the bomb before Hitler does. And that like that just lights a fire under you that I again, like the circumstances makeup. But I think that's actually pretty healthy, especially for researchers that are otherwise going to be really theoretical to take these, like, theorizing and say make this real physical thing happen. Meaning a lot of it is going to be unsexy. A lot of it is going to be like young firemen sitting there kind of inventing a notion of computation in order to compute what they needed to compute more quickly with, like the rudimentary automated tools that they had available. Um, I think you see this with Bell Labs also, where you've got otherwise very theorizing minds in very pragmatic contexts that I think is like really helpful for the theory as well as for the applications. So I think that sort of can be positive for progress. You mentioned Bell Labs and Manhattan Project. This kind of makes me curious for the things you create, which are quite singular, like if you look at all YouTube. Or just not YouTube. It doesn't matter what it is, it's just teaching content. Art doesn't matter. It's like, yep, that's. That's Grant, right, that's unique and your teaching style and everything, does it. Manhattan Project and Bell Labs was like famously a lot of brilliant people, but there's a lot of them. They play off of each other. So my question for you is it does get lonely. Honestly, that right there, I think is the biggest part of my life that I would like to change in some way that I look at a Bell Labs type situation. I'm like, God damn, I love that whole situation and I'm so jealous of it. And you're like reading about Heming. And then you see that he also shared enough with his fan. And you're like, of course he did. Of course they shared an office. That's how these ideas get. And they actually very likely worked separately. Yeah, totally, totally separate. But there's a literally and sorry to interrupt, there's a literally magic that happens when you run into each other, like on the way to, like, getting a snack or something. Conversations you overhear, other projects you're pulled into. It's like puzzles that colleagues are sharing, like all of that. Um, I have some extent of it just because I try to stay well connected in communities of people who think in similar ways. But it's not it's not in the day to day in the same way which I would like to fix somehow. That's one of the I would say one of the biggest one of the many drawbacks, negative things about this current pandemic is that whatever the term is, but like chance collisions are significantly reduced. I thought, I don't know why I saw this, but on my on my brother's work calendar, he had a scheduled slot with someone that he's scheduled a meeting. And the title of the whole meeting was No Specific Agenda. I just missed the happenstance, serendipitous conversations that we used to have with the pandemic and remote work has so cruelly taken away from us. Brilliant, though the title of them is brilliant. I like that's the way to do it. You just schedule those kinds of schedule, the serendipitous interaction. It's like I mean, you can't do an academic setting, but it's basically like going to a bar and sitting there just for the strangers you might meet, just the strangers or striking up conversation. Strangers on the train. Harder to do when you're deeply like maybe myself or maybe a lot of academic types who are like introverted and avoid human contact as much as possible. So it's nice when it's forced those chance collisions. But maybe scheduling is a possibility, but for the most part. Do you work alone, like I'm sure you struggle, like a lot like it, like this, like you probably hit moments when you look at this and say, like this is the wrong way to show. It is a long way to visualize it. I'm making it too hard for myself. I'm going down the wrong direction. This is too long to short all those self-doubt that could be paralyzing. What do you do in those moments? I actually much prefer, like work to be a solitary affair. For me, that's like a personality quirk. I would like it to be in an environment with others and like collaborative in the sense of ideas exchanged. But those phenomena you're describing when you say this is too long, this is too short, this visualization sucks. It's way easier to say that to yourself than it is to say to a collaborator. Um, and I know that's just the thing that I'm not good at. So in that way, it's very easy to just throw away a script because the script isn't working. It's hard to tell someone else they should do the same. Actually, last time we talked, I think it was like very close to me talking down. It was kind of cool. Like two people that eventually got that interview, as the heart know, can brag about something. Please. My my favorite thing is Don Knuth. After the interview, he offered to go out to hot dogs with the hot dogs. But that was never like people asking, what's the favorite thing you've ever done? I mean, that has to be. But unfortunately, I couldn't. I had a thing after, so I had to turn down Don Cornelius, you, Mr. Kluth. Dogs and dogs. So that was a little bragging. But the hot dogs is such a sweet. So, um, but the reason I bring that up is he he works through problems alone as well. He prefers that struggle, the struggle of it. You know, writers like Stephen King often talk about like their process of, you know, what they do, like what they eat when they wake up, like when they sit down, like how they like their desk and, you know, on a on a perfectly productive day. Like what they like to do, how long they like to work for, what enables them to think deeply, all that kind of stuff. Hunter S. Thompson did a lot of drugs. Everybody has their own thing. What do you ever thing is there if you were to lay out a perfect productive day or would that schedule look like, do you think? Part of that's hard to answer, because I like the mode of work I do changes a lot from day to day. Like some days I'm writing the thing I have to do is write a script. Some days I'm animating. The thing I have to do is animate something as I'm like working on the animation library. The thing I have to do is like a little I'm not a software engineer, but something in the direction of software engineering. Some days it's like a variant of research. It's like learned this topic well and try to learn it differently. So those is like four very different modes of what some days is like get through the email backlog of people. I've been on a task they've been putting off. It goes research, scripting, like the idea starts with research and then they're scripting and then there's programming and there's the, uh, show time and the research side. By the way, I like what's I think a problematic way to do it is to say I'm starting this project and therefore I'm starting the research instead. It should be that you're like ambient learning, a ton of things just in the background. And then once you feel like you have the understanding for one, you put it on the list of things that there can be a video for. Otherwise either you're going to end up roadblocked forever or you're just not going to have a good way of talking about it. But still, some of the days, it's like the thing to do is learn new things. So what's the most painful one? I think you mentioned scripting. Scripting is. Yeah, that's the worst. Yeah, right. Writing is the worst. So what's your perfectly. So let's take the hardest one. What's a perfectly productive day. You wake up and say, damn it, this is the day I need to do some scripting and like you didn't do anything last two days, so you came up with excuses to procrastinate. So today must be the day. Yeah, I wake up early, I, I guess I exercise and then I turn the Internet off. Uh, if we're writing. Yeah. That's, that's what's required is having the Internet off and then maybe you keep notes on the things that you want to Google when you're allowed to have the Internet. Again, I'm not great about doing that, but when I do, uh, that makes it happen. And then when I hit writer's block, like the solution to writer's block is to read doesn't even have to be related. Just read something different. I just for like fifteen minutes, half an hour and then go back to writing that when it's a nice cycle I think can work very well. And when you're writing the script you don't know where it ends. Right. Like you have a like problem solving videos. I know where it ends. Expositional videos. I don't know where it ends up coming up with, uh, with the magical thing that makes this whole story like this whole story together, that ones that happen. That's that's the thing that makes it such that a topic gets put on the list of people, that's an issue and you shouldn't start the project unless there's one of those and you have so many names back that you have such a big bag of. Aha. Moments already that you could just pull at. That's one of the things and one of the. Sad things about time and that nothing lasts forever and that we're all mortal. Let's not get into that discussion is, you know, if I see like even when I ask for people to ask, like ask, I did a call for questions and people weren't asking questions. And so many requests from people about, like certain videos they would love you to do is such a pile. And I think that's that's a sign of, like, admiration from people for sure. But it's like it makes me sad because like whenever I see them, people give ideas. They're all like very often really good ideas. And it's like it's such a makes me sad and the same kind of way. When I go through a library or through a bookstore, you see all these amazing books you'll never get to open. So. So, yeah, so do you. Yeah. But I enjoy the ones that you have enjoyed the books that are open and don't let yourself lament the ones that stay closed. What else is there any other magic to that day. Did you try to dedicate like a certain number of hours. Do you call Newport has this deep work kind of idea? I'm there systematic people who get really on top of, you know, the checklist of what they're going to do in the day and they like count their hours. And I am not a systematic person in that way. It's which is probably a problem. I very likely would get more done if I was systematic in that way. But that doesn't happen. So, you know, you talk to me, talk to me later in life, and maybe I will have, like, changed my ways and give you a very different answer. I think Benjamin Franklin, like later in life, figured out the rigor. Is these like very rigorous schedules and what had to be productive? I think those schedules are much more fun to write. Like it's very fun to write a schedule and make a blog post about, like the perfect, productive day, like might work for one person, but I don't know how much people get out of, like, reading them or trying to adopt someone else's style. And I'm not even sure that they've ever followed. Yeah, exactly. You're always going to write it as the best version of yourself. You're not going to explain the phenomenon of, like, wanting to get out of the bed, but not really wanting to get out of bed and all of that. And just like zoning out for random reasons or or the one that people probably don't touch at all is I try to check social media once a day, but I'm like only so I post and that's it. When I post, I check the previous days. That's like my what I try to do. That's what I do like 90 percent of the days. But then I'll go. I'll have like a two week period where it's just like I'm checking the Internet like I mean it's some probably some scary number of times and a lot of people can resonate with that. I think it's a legitimate addiction. It's like it's a dopamine addiction. And I don't know if it's a problem, because as long as it's the kind of socializing, like if you're actually engaging with friends and engaging with other people's ideas, I think it can be really useful. Well, I don't know. So for sure I agree with you, but and it's a it's definitely an addiction because for me, I think it's true for a lot of people. I am very cognizant of the fact I just don't feel that happy. If I look at a day where I've checked social media a lot, like if I just aggregate I did a self report, I'm sure I would find that I'm just like literally on like the less happy with my life and myself after I've done that check. When I check it once a day, I'm very like, I'm happy. I even like because I've seen it. OK, one way to measure that is when somebody says something not nice to you on the Internet is like when I check in once a day, I'm able to just like like I smile. Like I virtually I think about them positively empathetically. I send them love. I don't I don't have a response, but I just feel positively about the whole thing. If I check if I check like more than that, if it starts eating at me, I like start there is an eating thing that that happens. I like anxiety. It occupies a part of your mind that's not doesn't seem to be healthy. Same with. I mean, you you put stuff out on YouTube. I think it's important, I think you have a million dimensions that are interesting to you. But one of the interesting ones is the study of education and the psychological aspect of putting stuff up on YouTube. I like now have completely stopped checking statistics of any kind of release. An Episode 100 with my dad conversation, my dad, he checks. He's probably listening to this stop. He checks the number of views on his and his video and his conversation. So he discovered like a reason he's new to this whole addiction and he just checks and he like he'll text me or write to me. I just pass Dawkins and was like that that so much. Yeah. So he's, uh. Can I tell you a funny story to that effect of leisure, parental use of YouTube early on in the channel? My mom would like text me. She's like, uh, the channel has had 990000 views. The channels had nine hundred ninety one thousand views. I'm like, oh, that's cute. She's going to be a little part on the about page where you see the total number of channel news. No, she didn't know about that. She had been going every day through all the videos and then adding them up, adding them. And she thought she was like doing me this favor of providing me this like global analytica that otherwise wouldn't be visible. And so it's just like this addiction where you have some number you want to follow. And then like, yeah, it's funny that your dad had this. I think what a lot of people have it. I think that's probably a beautiful thing for like parents because they're legitimately they're proud. Yeah. They're as it's born of love. It's great. The downside, I feel when one of them is this is one interesting experience that you probably don't know much about because comments and your videos are super positive. But people judge the quality of how something went. Like, I see that with these conversations by the comments. Yeah. Like I'm not talking about like, you know, people in their 20s and their 30s. I'm talking about like CEOs of major companies who don't have time. They basically they literally this is their evaluation metric. They're like, oh, the comments seem to be positive. And that's really concerning to me. Most important lesson for any content creator to learn is that the commenting public is not representative of the actual public and this is easy to see. Ask yourself, how often do you read comments on YouTube videos? Most people will realize I never do it. Some people realize they do, but the people who realize they never do it should understand that that's a sign. The kind of people who are like you aren't the ones leaving comments. And I think this is important. A number of respects like in my case, I think I would think my content was better than it was if I just read comments because people are super nice. The thing is, the people who are bored by it are are put off by it in some way, are frustrated by it. Usually they just go away. They're certainly not going to watch the whole video, much less leave a comment on it. So there's a huge underrepresentation of like negative feedback, like well intentioned negative feedback, because very few people actively do that, like watch the whole thing that they dislike, figure out what they disliked, articulate what they dislike. Um, there's plenty of negative feedback that's not well intentioned, but for like that golden kind, uh, I think a lot of YouTube friends, I have at least have gone through phases of like anxiety about the nature of comments that stem from basically just this, that it's like people who aren't necessarily representative of who they were going for or misinterpreted what they're trying to say or whatever have you, or we're focusing on things like personal appearances as opposed to like substance. And they come away thinking like, oh, that's what everyone thinks. That's what everyone's response to this video was. Um, but a lot of the people who had the reaction you wanted them to have, like, they probably didn't write it down, so. Very important to learn, it also translates to realizing that you're not as important as you might think you are because all of the people commenting are the ones who love you the most and are like really asking you to, like, create certain things or like mad that you didn't create like a past thing. Um. I don't know, I have such a problem, like I have a very real problem with making promises about a type of content that I'll make and then either not following up on it soon or just like never following up on it. Yeah, I actually last time we talked, I think probably I'm not sure promise to me that you'll have music incorporated into your like. I'll share it with you privately. But there's an example of like what I had in mind, I like did a version of it. And like I think there's a better version of this that might exist one day. So it's now on the like the back burner. It's like it's sitting there. It was like a live performance at this one thing. I think next next circumstance that I'm like doing another recorded live performance that like fits having that been in a better recording can make it nice and public. May be a while, but exactly right. Um, the point I was going to make those like I know I'm bad about following up on stuff, uh, which is an actual problem. It's borne of the fact that I have a sense of what we'll be like, good content when it won't be. Um, but this can actually be incredibly disheartening because a ton of comments that I see are people who are like, uh, frustrated usually in a benevolent way that, like, I haven't followed through on like X and X, which I get. And I should do that. But what's comforting thought for me is that when there's a topic I haven't promised, but I am working on and I'm excited about, it's like the people who would really like this don't know that it's coming and don't know to like come in to that effect. And like the commenting public that I'm seeing is not representative of like who I think this other project will touch meaningfully, has a focus on the future, on the thing you're creating now, just like the. Yeah, the art of it. One of the people is really inspiring to me in that regard, because I've really seen it in person as Joe Rogan. He doesn't read comments, but not just that. He doesn't give a damn. He like legitimate. He's not, like, clueless about it. He's like just like the richness and the depth of a smile he has when he just experiences the moment with you. Like Off-line, you can tell he doesn't give a damn about like like. About anything, about what people think about weather, if it's on a podcast, you talk to them or whether offline about just it's not there like what other people think, how how even like with the rest of the day looks like it's just deeply in the moment or like especially like is what we're doing going to make for a good Instagram photo or something like that? That doesn't look like that at all. It's. I think for actually quite a lot of people, he's an inspiration in that way, but it was and in real life a show that you can be very successful not giving a damn about, about comments. And it sounds sounds bad not to read comments because it's like, well, there's a huge number of people who are deeply passionate about what you do. So you're ignoring them. Mm hmm. But at the same time, the nature of our platforms is such that the cost of listening to all the positive people who are really close to you, who are incredible people have been, you know, made a great community that you can learn a lot from. The cost of listening to those folks is also the cost of your psychology. Slowly being degraded by the natural underlying toxicity of the Internet is engaged with a handful of people deeply rather than like as many people as you can in a shallow way. I think that's a good lesson for social media usage like platforms. And generally athletes choose to just a handful of things to engage with and engage with it very well in a way that you feel proud of. And don't worry about the rest. Honestly, I think the best social media platform is texting. That's my favorite. That's my go to social media platform. Well, yeah, the best social media interaction is like real life, not social media, but social interaction. Well, yeah, no, no question there. I think everyone should agree with which, which sucks because it has been challenged now with the current situation. And we're trying to figure out what kind of platform can be created that we can do remote communication as those effective. It's important for education. It's important for just the question of education right now. Yeah. So on that topic, you've done a series of last year called Logged On Math. And you know, you want live, which is different than you usually do, maybe one, can you talk about how that feel? What's that experience like? Like in your own when you look back? Like, is that an effective way? Did you find being able to teach? And if so, is there a lessons for this world where all of these educators are now trying to figure out how the heck to teach remotely? For me, it was very different. As different as you can get, I'm on camera, which I'm usually not. I'm doing it live, which is nerve wracking. It was a slightly different level of topics, although realistically I'm just talking about things I'm interested in no matter what. I think the reason I did that was this thought that a ton of people are looking to learn remotely. The rate at which I usually put out content is too slow to be actively helpful. Let me just do some biweekly lectures that if you're looking for a place to point your students, if you're a student looking for a place to be edified about math, just tune in at these times. Um, and in that sense, I think it was, you know, a success for those who followed with it. It was a really rewarding experience for me to see how people engaged with it. Um, part of the fun of the live interaction was to actually like I do these live quizzes and see how people would answer and try to shape the lesson based on that or see what questions people were asking in the audience. I would love to if I did more things like that in the future, kind of tighten that feedback loop even more. Um, I think for, you know, you ask about like if this can be relevant to educators, like 100 percent online teaching is basically a form of live streaming now. I mean, usually it happens to resume. I think if teachers view what they're doing as a kind of performance and a kind of live stream performance, um, that would probably be pretty healthy because Zoom can be kind of awkward. Um, and I wrote up this little blog post actually just on like just what our setup looked like, if you want to adopt it yourself and how to integrate, um, like the broadcasting software OBEs with Zoom or things like that. It was really sad to pause on that. I mean, yeah, maybe you can look at the blog post, but it looked really nice. The thing is, I knew nothing about any of that stuff before I started. I had a friend who knew a fair bit, um, and so he kind of helped show me the ropes. One of the thing that I realized is that you could as a teacher, like it doesn't take that much to make things look and feel pretty professional. Um, like one component of it is as soon as you hook things up with the broadcasting software, rather than just doing like screen sharing, you can set up different scenes and then you can have keyboard shortcuts to transition between those scenes. So you don't need a production studio with a director calling like go to camera three, go to camera two, like onto the screen instead. You can have control of that. And it took a little bit of practice and I would mess it up now and then. But I think I had a decently smooth such that, you know, I'm talking to the camera and then we're doing something on the paper. Then we're doing like a, um, playing with the demos graph or something and something that I think in the past would have required a production team you can actually do as a solo operation and in particular as a teacher. And I think it's worth it to try to do that because, uh, two reasons. One might get more engagement from the students. But the biggest reason I think one of the best things that can come out of this pandemic education wise is if we train a bunch of teachers into content creators and if we take lessons that are usually done in these ONE-OFF settings and like start to get in the habit of, um, sometimes I'll use the phrase commodity's explanation where what you want is. Whatever a thing a student wants to learn, it just seems inefficient to me that that lesson is taught millions of times over in parallel across many different classrooms in the world, like year to year. You've got a given algebra one lesson that's just taught like literally millions of times by different people. What should happen is that there's the small handful of explanations online that exist so that when someone needs that explanation, they can go to it, that the time in classroom is spent on all of the parts of teaching and education that aren't explanation, which is most of it. Right. And the way to get there is to basically have more people who are already explaining, publish their explanations and have it in a publicized forum. So if during a pandemic you can have people. Automatically creating online content because it has to be online, but getting in the habit of doing it in a in a way that doesn't just feel like a zoom call that happened to be recorded, but it actually feels like a piece that was always going to be publicized to more people than just your students. That can be really powerful. And there's an improvement process there like so being self-critical and growing like, you know, I guess you two words go through this process of like putting out some content and like nobody caring about it and then trying to figure out, like, you're basically improving, figure out like, why did nobody care? What can I, you know? And they come up with all kinds of answers which may or may not be correct, but doesn't matter because the answer leads to improvement. So you're being constantly self-critical yourself, analytical, and it's better to say. So you think of like, how can I make the audio better, like all the basic things. Maybe one question to ask because well, by way of Dedrick, he's a robotics professor at MIT, one of my favorite people, a big fan of yours, who watched our first conversation. I just interviewed him a couple of weeks ago. He he teaches this course and under robotics, which is like robotic systems, when you can't control everything, when you're like we as humans, when we walk, we're always falling forward, which means like is gravity. You can't control it. You just hope you can catch yourself. But that's not all guaranteed and depends on the. So that's undersaturated. You can't control everything or the the number of actuators, the degrees of freedom you have is not enough to fully control the system. So I don't know. It's a really, I think, beautiful, fascinating class. He puts it online. It's quite popular. He does an incredible job teaching. He puts online every time. But he's kind of been interested in, like crisping it up, like, you know, making it, you know, innovating in different kinds of ways. And he was inspired by the work you do, because I think in his work he can do similar kind of explanations as you're doing, like revealing the beauty of it and spending like months and preparing a single video. And he's interested in how to do that. That's why I listen to the conversation. He's playing with Manam, but he had this question of, you know. Of, you know, like in my apartment, we did the interview like curtains, like for like a black curtain. This is this is a giant mansion. And that also is but you basically I have like a black curtain or whatever, you know, makes it really easy to set up a filming situation with cameras that we have here. These microphones. He was asking, you know, what kind of equipment do you recommend? I guess a blog post is a good one. I said I don't recommend this is excessive and actually really hard to work with. So I wonder, I mean, is there something you would recommend terms of equipment? Like is it do you work do you think? Like lapel mikes, like USB mikes? For my narration, I use a USB make for the streams. I use the lapel mike, uh, the narration. It's a blue yeti. I'm forgetting actually the name of the lapel mic, but it was probably like a road of some kind. But is it hard to figure out how to make the audio sound good? Oh, I mean, listen to all the early videos on my channel and clearly, like, I'm terrible at this for for some reason I just couldn't get audio for a while. I think it's weird when you hear your own voice. So you're like, this sounds weird and it's hard to know. Does it sound weird because you're not used to your own voice or they're like actual audio artifacts that play. Um. So in the video is just for the lockdown, just the camera, like you said, it was probably streaming somehow through the yeah, there were two five cameras, one that was mounted overhead over a piece of paper. You could also use like an iPad or a wake up tablet to do your writing electronically. But I just wanted the paper feel, um, one on the face. There's two again, I don't know, like just not actually the one to ask this because I like animated stuff usually, but each of them, like, has a compressor object that makes it such that the camera output goes into the computer, the USB, but like it's compressed before it does that the the live aspect of it. Do you do you regret doing it live? Not at all. I think I do think the content might be like much less sharp and tight than if it were something even that I just recorded like that and then edit it later. But I do like something that I do to be out there to show like, hey, this is what it's like, this is what it's like when I make mistakes. This is like the piece of thinking, um, I like the live interaction of it. I think that made it better. Uh, I probably would do it on a different channel, I think if I did a series like that in the future, just because it's it's a different style, it's probably a different target audience and kind of keep clean what three blue and brown is about versus, uh, the benefits of, like live lectures. Do you just like in this time of covid that people like us or other educators try to go like the the shorter like twenty minute videos that are like really well planned out or scripted, you really think through, you slowly design. So it's not live. Do you see like that being an important part of what they do. Yeah, well what I think teachers like Rothera do is choose the small handful of topics that they're going to do just really well. They want to create the best short explanation of it in the world. That will be one of those handfuls in a world where you have commodities do explanation, right? Most of the lectures should be done just normally. So put that and planning into it. I'm sure he's a wonderful teacher and like knows all about that. But maybe choose those small handful of topics do with beneficial for me sometimes, as if I do sample lessons with people on that topic to get some sense of how other people think about it. Let that inform how you want to edit it or scripted or whatever format you want to do. Some people are comfortable just explaining it and editing later. I'm more comfortable like writing it out and thinking about setting. Yeah, it's kind of sad. Sorry to interrupt. It's it's a little bit sad to me to see how much knowledge is lost. Like just just like you mentioned, there's professors like we can take my dad, for example, to blow up his ego a little bit, but he's a he's a great teacher and he knows plasma, plasma chemistry, plasma physics really well. So he can very simply explain some beautiful but otherwise complicated concepts. And it's sad that, like, if you Google plasma or like for plasma physics, like there's no videos. And just imagine if every one of those excellent teachers like your father, like Russ, even if they just chose one one this year, just like I'm going to make the best video that I can on this topic. If every one of the great teachers did that, the Internet would be replete. And it's already replete with great explanations, but it would be even more so with all the great explanations and like anything you want to learn. And there's a self-interest to it for in terms of teacher, in terms of even so, if you take Russ, for example, it's not that he's teaching something like he teaches his main thing, his thing he's deeply passionate about. And from a selfish perspective, it's also just like. I mean, it's a it's a it's like publishing a paper in a really like nature has like letters, like accessible publication. It's just going to guarantee that your work, that your passion is seen by a huge number of people, whatever the definition of huge is, doesn't matter. It's much more than it otherwise would be. And it's those lectures that tell early students what to be interested in. Yeah. At the moment, I think students are disproportionately interested in the things that are well represented on YouTube so that any educator out there, if you're wondering, hey, I want more like grad students in my department, like, what's the best way to recruit grad students? It's like make the best video you can and then wait eight years and then you're going to have a pile of, like, excellent grad students for that department. And one of the lessons I think your channel teaches is there is appeal of explaining just something beautiful, explaining a cleanly technically not doing a marketing video about why topology is great. There's yeah. That's there's people interested in this stuff. Yeah. I mean, one of the greatest channels, like it's not even a math channel, but the channel with greatest math content is versus. Yeah. Like interviewed. I imagine you were to propose making a video that explains the Baunach Turkey paradox substantively. Right. Not, not showing around it, maybe not describing things in terms of um, like the group theoretic terminology that you usually see in the paper. But the actual results that went into this idea of like breaking apart a sphere, proposing that to like a network TV station, saying, yeah, I'm going to do this in-depth talk of the binocs Haski paradox. I'm pretty sure it's going to reach 20 million people if they get out of here. Like no one cares about that. No one's interested in anything, even anywhere near that. But then you have Michael's quirky personality around it and just people that are actually hungry for that kind of depth. Um. Then you don't need, like, the approval of some higher network, you can just do it and let the people speak for themselves. So I think, you know, if your father was to make something on plasma physics or if we were to have like under actualised robotics that undersaturated under actuated. Yes, not under actualise. Plenty actualised under robotics and most robotics is under actualised. That's true. So even if it's things that you might think are nesh, I bet you'll be surprised by how many people actually engage with it really deeply. Although I just psychologically watching him, I can't speak for a lot of people speak for my dad. I think there's. There's a little bit of a skill gap, but I think that could be overcome, that's pretty big. None of us know how to make video when we start the first. If I made was terrible in a number of respects, like look at the earliest videos and in the YouTube channel, except for Captain Disillusion. And they're all like terrible versions of whatever they are now. But the thing I've noticed, especially like with world experts, is it's the same thing that I'm sure you went through, which is like fear of embarrassment. Like they they definitely. It's it's the same reason, like I feel that any time I put out a video, I don't know if you still feel that, but like. I don't know, it's this imposter syndrome, like, who am I to talk about this and that? That's true for, like, even things that you've studied for, like, your whole life. I don't know. It's scary to post stuff on YouTube. It is scary. I honestly wish that more of the people who had that. Modesty to say, who am I to post this were the ones actually posting it? That's right. I mean, that's the honest problem is like a lot of the educational content is supposed to be people who, like, we're just starting to research it two weeks ago and are on a certain schedule and who maybe should think like who am I to explain it? Choose your favorite topic, quantum mechanics or something. Um, and the people who have the self-awareness to not post are probably the people also best positioned to give a good, honest explanation of it. That's why there's a lot of value in a channel like no file where they basically trap a really smart person and force them to explain stuff on a sheet of paper. So but of course, that's not scalable as a single channel. If they if there's anything beautiful that could be done as people take it in their own hands, educators, which is again circling back, I do think the pandemic will serve to force a lot of people's hands. You're going to be making online content anyway. It's happening, right? Just hit that publish button and see how it goes. Yeah, see, how goes the cool thing about YouTube is it might not go for a while, but like 10 years later, right? Yeah, it'll be like this. The thing where people don't understand with YouTube, at least for now, at least that's my. Hope with it is it's a leg, it's it's literally better than publishing a book in terms of the legacy, it will live for a long, long time. Of course, it's one of the things I mentioned Joe Rogan before. It's kind of there's a sad thing because I'm a fan. He's moving to Spotify. Yeah, yeah, nine digit numbers will do that to you, but he doesn't really that he's one a person that doesn't actually care that much about money, like having talked to him. It wasn't because of money. It's because he legitimately thinks that they're going to do like a better job. So they're so from his perspective, YouTube, you have to understand where they're coming from. YouTube has been cracking down on people who they you know, Joe Rogan talks to Alex Jones and conspiracy theories. And YouTube is really I care for that kind of stuff. And that's not a good feeling. Like and Joe didn't doesn't feel like YouTube was on his side. You know, he's often has videos that they don't put in trending that like are obviously should be in trending because they're nervous about like, you know, if this is this is this content going to, you know, upset people, all that kind of stuff have misinformation. And that's not a good place for a person to be in. Spotify is going we're never going to censor you. We're never going to do that. But the reason I bring that up, whatever you think about that, I personally think that's bullshit because podcasting should be free and not constrained to a platform as pirate radio. What the hell? You can't as much as I love Spotify, you can't just you can't put fences around it. But anyway, the reason I bring that up is Joe's going to remove his entire library from YouTube. Whoa. Really? That's going to do his full length. The clips are going to stay with the full length. Videos are all I mean, made private or deleted as part of the deal. And like that's the first time where I was like, oh, YouTube videos might not live forever. Like things you find like, OK, so this is why I need a typeface or something where it's like if there's a content link. I familiar with the system at all. Like right now if you have a URL that points to a server, there's like a system where the address points to content and then it's like distributed. So you can't actually delete what's at that address because it's its content addressed. And as long as there's someone on the network who hosts it, it's always accessible at the address that it once was. But I mean, that raises a question. I'm not going to put you on the spot, but like somebody like Visa's, right? Spotify comes along and gives him, let's say, one hundred billion dollars, OK, let's say some crazy number and then we'll remove it from YouTube. Right. It's maybe. I don't know, for some reason, I thought YouTube is forever, I don't think it will be I mean, you know, another variant of this might take is like that, you know, you fast forward 50 years and, you know, Google or Alphabet isn't the company that it once was. And it's kind of struggling to make ends meet. And, you know, it's been supplanted by the whoever wins on the R game or whatever it might be. And then they're like, you know, all of these videos that we're hosting are pretty costly. So we're just we're going to start deleting the ones that aren't watched that much and tell people to, like, try to back them up on their own or whatever it is, or even if it does exist in some form forever. It's like if people are not habituated to watching YouTube in 50 years, they're watching something else, which seems pretty likely like it would be shocking if YouTube remained as popular as it is now indefinitely into the future. So it won't be forever. Makes me sad still, but because it's such a nice it's just like you said of the canonical videos, sorry I didn't have to, you know, usually get one minute on the on the thing and then talk to him about permanence. I think you would have a good conversation. Who's that. So he's the one that founded this thing called epiphytes that I'm talking about. And if you have him talk about basically what you're describing, like, oh, it's sad that this isn't forever, then you'll get some articulate quantification around it. Yeah, it's like been pretty well thought through. But yeah, I do see YouTube, just like you said, as a as a place like what your channel creates, which is like a set of canonical videos on a topic like others could create videos on that topic as well. But as a collection it creates a nice set of places to go. If you're curious about a particular topic, and it seems like coronaviruses, a nice opportunity to put that knowledge out there in the world at MIT and beyond. I have to talk to you a little bit about machine learning and deep learning and so on. Again, we talked about last time you have a set of beautiful videos on your own that works. Let me ask you first, what is the most beautiful aspect of neural networks and machine learning to you, like for making those videos from watching how the field is evolving? Is there something mathematically or an applied sense just beautiful to you about them? Well, I think what I would go to the layered structure and how you can have would feel like qualitatively distinct things happening going from one layer to another, but that are following the same mathematical rule. Because you look at as a piece of math, it's like you got a non-linearity and then you've got a matrix multiplication. That's what's happening. And all these layers, um, but especially if you look at like some of the visualizations that, like Chris Olá has done with respect to, um, like convolutional nets that have been trained on image net, trying to say, what does this neuron do? What do this does this family of neurons do? What you can see is that the ones closer to the input side are picking up on very low level ideas like the texture. Right. And then as you get further back, you have higher level ideas like what is the where the eyes in this picture and then how do the eyes form like an animal? Is this animal a cat or a dog or a deer? You have this series of qualitatively different things happening, even though it's the same piece of math on each one. So that's a pretty beautiful idea that you can have, like a generalisable object that runs through the layers of abstraction, which in some sense constitute intelligence, is having those many different layers of an understanding to something from abstractions in an automated way. Exactly. It's automated abstracting, which I mean, that just feels very powerful. And the idea that it can be so simply mathematically represented, I mean, it's kind of like modern animal research seems a little bit like you do a bunch of ad hoc things. Then you decide which one worked and then you retrospectively come up with the mathematical reason that it always had to work. Um, but, you know, who cares how you came to it when you have, like, that elegant piece of math? It's hard not to just smile seeing it work in action. Well, and when you talked about topology before, one of the really interesting things is a. That's beginning to be investigated under kind of the fields of like science and deep learning, which is like the craziness of the surface that is trying to be optimized in neural networks. I mean, the the amount of local minima, local optima there is in these services and somehow a dumb gradient descent algorithm is able to find really good solutions. That's like that's really surprising. Well, so on the one hand it is. But also it's like not it's not terribly surprising that you have these interesting points that exist when you make your space so high dimensional, like three. What did it have, 175 billion parameters. So it doesn't feel as mesmerizing to think about? Oh, there's some surface of intelligent behavior in this crazy high dimensional space. Like, there's so many parameters that, of course. But what's more interesting is like how how is it that you're able to efficiently get there, which is maybe what you're describing, that something as dumb as gradient descent does it? But like the the reason the gradient descent works well with neural networks and not just choose however you want to parametrized the space and then apply gradient descent to it, is that layered structure lets you decompose the derivative in a way that makes it computationally feasible? Um, yeah, it's just that, that there's so many good solutions, probably infinitely, infinitely many good solutions. Not best solutions, but good solutions. That's that's what's interesting. It's similar to a Stephen Wolfram as this idea of like. The if you just look at all space of computations, of all space, of basically algorithms, that you'd be surprised how many of them are actually intelligent, like if you just randomly pick from the bucket, that's surprising. We tend to think like a tiny, tiny minority of them would be intelligent. But his sense is like it seems weirdly easy to find computations that do something interesting. Well, OK. Is that from like a Kamogawa Kamogawa of complexity standpoint, almost everything will be interesting. What's fascinating is to find the stuff that's describable with low information, but still does interesting things like one fine example of this, you know, Shannons, noisy coding in Theorem, Noisey coding theorem and information theory that basically says if I want to send some bits to you, maybe some of them are going to get flipped. There's some noise along the channel. I can come up with some way of coding it. That's resilient to that noise. That's very good. And then he quantitatively describes a very good is what's funny about how he proves the existence of good error correction codes is rather than saying like here's how to construct it or even like a sensible nonconstructive proof the nature of his non-constructive proof is to say if we chose a random encoding, it would be almost at the limit, which is weird because then it took decades for people to actually find any that were anywhere close to the limit. And what his proof was saying is choose a random one. And it's like the best kind of encoding you'll ever find. But what's. What that tells us is that sometimes when you choose a random element from this ungodly huge set, that's a very different task from finding an efficient way to actively describe it, because in that case, the random element to actually implement it as a bit of code, you would just have this huge table of, like, telling you how to encode one thing into another that's totally, computationally infeasible. So on the side of like, how many possible programs are interesting in some way, it's like, well, tons of them. But the much, much more delicate question is when you can have a low information description of something that still becomes interesting and thereby this kind of gives you a blueprint for how to engineer that kind of thing right now. Yes, there is another good instance. There was like, yeah, a ton of things are hard to describe, but how do you have ones that have a simple set of governing equations that remain like arbitrarily hard to describe? Well, let me ask you, you mentioned DPG three. It's interesting to ask, what are your thoughts about the recently released open AGP T3 model that I believe is already trying to learn how to communicate like Grant's Anderson? You know, I think I got an email a day or two ago about someone who wanted to try to use D3 with Manam where you would, like, give it a high level description of something, and then it'll automatically create the mathematical animation, like trying to put me out of a job here. I mean, it probably won't put you out of a job, but to create something visually beautiful for sure, I would be surprised if that worked, as stated. But maybe there's like variants of it like that you can get to. I mean, like a lot of those demos. It's interesting. I think there's a lot of failed experiments. Depending on how you prime the thing, you're going to have a lot of failed. I mean, certainly with code programs synthesis, most of it won't even run. But eventually, I think if you if you're if you pick the right examples, you'll be able to generate something cool. And I think even that's good enough, even though if if it's if you're being very selective, it's still cool that something can be generated. Yeah, that's huge value. I mean, think of the writing process sometimes as a big part of it is just getting a bunch of stuff on the page and then you can decide what to whittle down to. So if it can be used in like a man machine symbiosis where it's just giving you a SPU of potential ideas that then you can refine down like it's serving as the generator and then the Human Services, the refiner, that seems like a pretty powerful dynamic. Yeah. Have you have you gotten a chance to see any of the demos like on Twitter? Is there a favorite you've seen or. Oh my absolute favorite. Yeah. So Tim Blay, who runs a channel called Acappella Science, he was like tweeting a bunch about playing with it. And so so Deepthi was trained on the Internet from before covid. So so in a sense, it doesn't know about the coronavirus. So what he seeded it with was just a short description about like a novel virus emerges in Wuhan, China, and starts to spread around the globe. What follows is a month by month description of what happens January Kotlin. Right? That's what he said. So then what it generates is like January than a paragraph of description, February and such. And it's the funniest thing you'll ever read because it predicts a zombie apocalypse, which of course it would, because it's drained on like the into the internal mysteries. But what you see unfolding is a description of covid-19 if it were a zombie apocalypse and like the early aspects of it, are kind of shockingly in line with what's reasonable and then it gets out so quickly. And the other flipside of that is I wouldn't be surprised if it's onto something at some point here when, you know, 2020 has been full of surprises, like we might all be in like this crazy militarized zone, as it predicts, just a couple of months off. Yeah, I think there's definitely an interesting tool of storytelling. It has struggled with mathematics, which is interesting or just even numbers. It's able to it's not able to generate like patterns. You know, like you give it in like five digit numbers and it's not able to figure out the sequence, you know, or like I didn't look in too much, but I'm talking about, like, sequences like the Fibonacci numbers to see how far can go because obviously it's leveraging stuff from the Internet and it starts to lose it. But it is also cool that I've seen it able to generate some interesting patterns that are mathematically correct. Yeah, I honestly haven't dug into like what's going on within it in a way that I can speak intelligently to. I guess it doesn't surprise me that it's bad in numerical patterns because. I mean, maybe I should be more impressed with it, but like that requires having a weird combination of intuitive and and formulaic worldview. So you're not just going off of intuition when you see Fibonacci numbers, you're not saying, like intuitively, what do I think will follow the 13? Like, I've seen patterns a lot where like 13 there, followed by 20 ones. Instead, it's that like the way you're starting to see a shape of things is by knowing what hypotheses to test where you're saying, oh, maybe it's generated based on the previous terms or maybe it's generated based on like multiplying by a constant or whatever it is you like have a bunch of different hypotheses and your intuitions are around those hypotheses, but you still need to actively test it. Um, and it seems like theory is extremely good at like that sort of pattern matching recognition that usually is very hard for computers. That is what humans get good at through expertise and exposure to lots of things. It's why it's good to learn from as many examples as you can rather than just from the definitions. It's to get that level of intuition, but to actually concretize it into a piece of math, you do need to like test your hypotheses and if not, prove it, um, like have an actual explanation for what's going on, not just a pattern that you've seen. And but then the flip side, to play devil's advocate, that's a very kind of probably correct intuitive understanding of just like we said, a few a few layers creating abstractions, but it's been able to form. Something that looks like a compression of the data that it's seen, that looks awfully a lot like it understands what the heck is talking about? Well, I think a lot of understanding is like I don't mean to denigrate pattern recognition. Pattern recognition is most of understanding and it's super important and it's super hard. And so, like, when is demonstrating this kind of real understanding, compressing down some data like that, that might be pattern recognition at its finest? My only point would be that like what differentiates math, I think to a large extent, is that the pattern recognition isn't sufficient and that the kind of patterns that you're recognizing are not like the end goals, but instead they're they are the little bits and paths that get you to the end goal. That's certainly true for mathematics in general. And it's an interesting question. If that might for certain kinds of series of numbers, it might not be true like you might, because it's a basic, you know, like Talercio like certain kinds of series, it feels like. Compressing the Internet is is enough to figure out because those patterns in some form appear in the text somewhere. Well, I mean, there's all sorts of wonderful examples of false patterns in math where one of the earliest videos I put on the channel was talking about the extent of dividing a circle up using these chords. And you see this pattern of one, two, four, eight, 16. It's like, oh, it's pretty easy to see what that pattern is. It's powers of two. We've seen it a million times, but it's not powers of two. The next term is thirty one. And so it's like almost a power of two, but it's a little bit shy and there's there's actually a very good explanation for what's going on. Um, but I think it's a good test of whether you're thinking clearly about mechanistic explanations of things, how quickly you jump to thinking it must be powers of two, because the problem itself, there's really no no good way to I mean, there can't be a good way to think about it as like doubling a set, because ultimately it doesn't. But even before it starts to, it's not something that screams out as being a troubling phenomenon. So at best, if it did turn out to be powers of two, it would have only been so very subtly. And I think the difference between, like, you know, a math student making the mistake in a mathematician who's experienced seeing that kind of pattern is that they they'll have a sense from what the problem itself is, whether the pattern that they're observing is reasonable and how to test it. And like. I would just be very impressed if there was any algorithm that was actively accomplishing that goal. Yeah, like a learning based algorithm. Like a little scientist, I guess, basically. Yeah. It's a it's a fascinating thought because GBG, three of these language models already accomplishing way more than I've expected. So I'm learning not to doubt, but we'll get there. Yeah, I, I'm not saying I'd be impressed, but like surprised, like I'll be impressed, but I think we'll get there on, um, algorithms doing math like that. So one of the amazing things you've done for the world is to some degree, open sourcing, the tooling that you use to make your videos with Manam this Python library. Now, it's quickly evolving because I think you're inventing new things every time you make a video. In fact, I wanted I've been working on playing around with something I wanted to do, like an ode to blue and Brown. Like I love playing Hendrix. I wanted to do like a cover of a concept. I wanted to visualize and use Manam. And I saw that you had like a little piece of code on like Mobius strip and try to do some cool things with spinning a Mobius strip, like continue. Twisting it, I guess, is the term, and it was easier to. It was tough, so I haven't figured it out yet. Well, so I guess the question I want to ask is so many people love it that you've put that out there. They want to do the same thing as I do with Hendryx. I want to cover it. They want to explain an idea using the tool, including Russ. How would you recommend they try to. I'm very sorry. They try to go they try to go buy about it. Well, and what kind of choices should they choose to be most effective? That I can answer. So I always feel guilty if this comes up because I think of it like the scrapie tool. That's like a math teacher who put together some code. People asked what it was, so they made it open source and they kept scrapping it together. And there's a lot like a lot of things about it that make it harder to work with. And it needs to be that are a function of like me not being a software engineer. Um, I've put some work this year trying to, like, make it better and more flexible. Um, that is still just kind of like a work in process. Um, one thing I would love to do is just get my act together about properly integrating with what the community wants to work with and like what stuff I work on and making that not like deviate and just like actually fostering that community in a way that I've I've been shamefully neglectful of. So I'm just always guilty if it comes up. So let's put that guilt aside just then. Like I then I'll pretend like it isn't terrible for someone like Russ. Um, I think step one is like make sure that what you're intimating should be done so programmatically because a lot of things maybe shouldn't, um. Like if you're just making a quick graph of something, if it's a graphical intuition that maybe has a little motion to it, use decimals, use graph or use jojoba, use Mathematica, certain things that are like really oriented around jojoba is kind of cool. I did something super amazing. You can get very, very far with it. And in a lot of ways, like it would make more sense for some stuff that I do to just do angioedema. But I kind of have the cycle of liking to try to improve and by doing videos and such, so do as I say, not as I do. The original like thought I had and making Menom was that there's so many different ways of representing functions other than graphs, um, in particular things like transformation's, like use movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputs instead of like X direction in my direction or like vector fields or things like that. So I wanted something that was flexible enough that you didn't feel constrained into a graphical environment. Um, by graphical I mean like graphs with the like X coordinate like why coordinate kind of stuff. But also make sure that. You're taking advantage of the fact that it's programatic, you have loop's, you have conditionals, you have abstraction, if any of those are like well fit for what you want to teach to, you know, have a scene type that you tweak a little bit based on parameters or to have conditionals so that things can go one way or another or loops, so that you can create these things of like arbitrarily increasing complexity. That's the stuff that's like meant to be animated programmatically. If it's just like writing some text on the screen or shifting around objects or something like that, um, things like that, you should probably just use Keano. Right. You'd be a lot simpler. So, uh, try to find a workflow that distills down that which should be programatic into Menom and that which doesn't need to be into like other domains. Again, do as I say, not as I do. I mean, Python is an integral part of it. And just for the fun of it, I may ask what what's your most and least favorite aspects of Python? Most and least I mean, I love that it's like object oriented and functional. I guess that you can kind of like get both of those, um, uh, benefits for how you structure things. So if you would just want to quickly whip something together, the functional aspects are nice. It's your primary language, like for programmatically generating stuff. Yeah, it's home for me. It's helpful. Yeah. Sometimes I travel by home that it's home. Uh, I mean the biggest disadvantage is that it's slow. So when you're doing computationally intensive things, either you have to think about it more than you should, how to make it efficient or, uh, just like takes long. Do you run into that at all, like with your work? Well, so certainly Old Menom is like way slower than it needs to be because of, uh, how it renders things on the back end is like kind of absurd. I've rewritten things such that it's all done with like shaders in such a way that it should be just like Leive and actually like interactive while you're coding it, if you want to to you have like a 3D scene, you can move around. You can have, um, elements respond to where your mouth is or things. That's not something that user of a video is going to get to experience because there's just a play button and a pause button. But while you're developing, that can be nice. Um, so it's gotten better in speed in that sense. But that's basically because the hard work is being done in the language. That's not Python but Glassell. Right. Um, but yeah, there are some times when it's like a um, there's just a lot of data that goes into the object that I want to animate that. Then it just like Python is slow. Well, let me ask quickly ask what do you think about the Walrus operator if you're familiar with it all? The reason it's interesting, there's a new operator in Python, three point eight. I find it psychologically interesting because the toxicity over it led to resign, to step down is actually true, or was it like there's a bunch of surrounding things that also was it actually the wall was operated that while it was it was tax, it was an accumulation of toxicity. But that was the the most that was the most toxic one. Like the discussion. That's the most number of Python core developers that were opposed to Guido's decision. Hmm. He didn't particularly, I don't think cared about it either way. He just thought it was a good idea to approve it. And like the structure of the idea of a bedfellows, like you listen. Ever hear of radio? You make a decision and you move forward, and he didn't like the negativity that burden him after that, people like some parts of the benevolent dictator for life mantra. But once the dictator does things different than you want, suddenly a dictatorship doesn't seem so great. Yeah, I mean, they still like that. He just couldn't because he truly is the be in the benevolent. He's he really is a nice guy. I mean, and I think he can't it's a lot of toxicity is difficult. It's a difficult job. That's why Linus Torvalds is perhaps the way he is. You have to have a thick skin to fight off, fight off the warring masses. It's kind of surprising to me how many people can, like, threaten to murder each other over whether we should have Brace's or not or whether I like. It's incredible. Yeah. I mean, that's my knee jerk reaction to the Wall Street is like I don't actually care that much either way. I'm not going to get really passionate. My my initial reaction was like, yeah, this seems to make things more confusing to read, but then again, so does list comprehension until you're used to it. So like if you use for it, great, if not great. But like let's just all calm down about our spaces versus Tab's debates here in like feature. Yeah. To me it just represents the the value of great leadership, even in open source communities. Doesn't represent that if he steps down as a leader while he fought for it, he got it passed I guess. But I guess I could represent multiple things too. It can represent like a failed dictatorship or represents a lot of things. But to me, great leaders take risks even if it. Even if it's a mistake at the end, like you have to make decisions. The thing is this world won't go anywhere if you can't if whenever there's a divisive thing, you wait until the division is no longer there. That's the paralysis we experienced with Congress and political systems. It's good to be slow when there's indecision, when there's people disagree. It's good to take your time. But like at a certain point, it results in paralysis and you just have to make a decision. The background of the site, whether it's yellow, blue or red, can cause people to go to war over other, which I've seen this with design. People are very touchy on color color choices. At the end of the day, just make a decision and go with it. I think that that's what the wireless operator represents to me, is they represents the fighter pilot instinct of like quick action is more important than, uh, than just carrying everybody out. And really they get through it because that's going to lead to paralysis. Yeah, like, if that's the actual case that, you know, it's something we're consciously hearing people's, uh, disagreement, disagreeing with that disagreement and saying he wants to move forward anyway. Uh, yeah, that's an admirable aspect of leadership. So we don't have much time, but I want to ask just because it's some beautiful mathematics involved, 20, 20 bodies, a couple of in the physics world theories of everything. Eric Wilstein, kind of I mean, he's been working for probably decades, but he put out this idea of geometric unity or started sort of publicly thinking and talking about it more. Stephen Wolfram put out his physics project, which is kind of the type of graph view of a theory of everything. Do you find interesting, beautiful things to these theories of everything? What do you think about the physics world and sort of the beautiful, interesting, insightful mathematics in that world, whether we're talking about quantum mechanics, which you touched on a bunch of your videos, a little bit quaternions like just the mathematics involved or the general relativity, which is more about surfaces and topology, all that stuff. Well, I think as far as like popularized science is concerned, people are more interested in theories of everything than they should be like, because the problem is whether we're talking about trying to make sense of why Einstein's lectures or Wolfram's project or let's just say like listening to Whiton talk about string theory, whatever proposed path to a theory of everything, um, you're not actually going to understand it. Some physicists will. But like, do you just not actually going to understand the substance of what they're saying? What I think is way, way more productive is to let yourself get really interested in the phenomena that are still deep, but which you have a chance of understanding, because the path to getting to like even understanding what questions these theories of everything are trying to answer involves like walking down that. I mean, I was watching a video before I came here about from Steve Moore talking about why sugar polarizes light in a certain way. So fascinating. Like really, really interesting. It's not like this novel theory of everything type thing, but to understand what's going on there really requires digging in depth to certain ideas. And if you let yourself think past what the video tells you about what the circularly polarised light mean and things like that, it actually would get you to a pretty good appreciation of like two state states and quantum systems in a way that just trying to read about like what's the what are the hard parts about resolving quantum field theories with general relativity is never going to get you. So as far as popularizing science is concerned, like. The audience should be less interested than they are in the use of everything, the popularizers should be less emphatic than are about that for like actual practicing physicists, I might be the case. Maybe more people should think about fundamental questions, but it's difficult to create like a three blue one brown video on the theory of everything. So basically, we should really try to find the beauty and mathematics of physics by looking at concepts that are like within reach. Yeah, I think that's super important. I mean, so you see this in math, too, with the big unsolved problems. So like the millennium problems remain hypothesis. Have you ever done a video on Fermat's last theorem? I have. Not yet, no. But if I did, do you know what I would do? I would talk about proving Fermat's last theorem in the specific case of an equals three. Yeah, that's still accessible. Yes, actually barely. Mythology might be able to do a like a great job on this. He does a good job of taking stuff that's barely accessible in making it. But the the core ideas of proving it for any three are hard. But they do get you real ideas about Algebraic No3. It involves looking at a number of field that it lives in the complex plane. It looks like a hexagonal lattice and you start asking questions about factoring numbers in the Texarkana lattice. So it takes a while. But I've talked about this sort of like lattice arithmetic in other contexts and you can get to a understanding of that. And the things that make Fermat's last theorem hard are actually quite deep. Um, and so the cases that we can solve it for, it's like you can get these broad sweeps based on some hard but like accessible, um, bits of no theory. But before you can even understand why the general cases, as hard as it is, you have to walk through those. And so any other attempt to describe it would just end up being like shallow and not really productive for the viewers time. I think the same goes for most like unsolved problem type things where I think, you know, as a kid, I was actually very inspired by the twin prime conjecture that, like, totally sucked me in is this thing that was understandable. I kind of had this dream like, oh, maybe I'll be the one to prove the twin prime conjecture and new math that I would learn would be like viewed through this lens of like, oh, maybe I can apply it to that in some way. But you sort of mature to a point where you realize. You should spend your brain cycles on problems that you will see resolved because then you're going to grow to see what it feels like for these things to be resolved rather than spending your brain cycles on something where it's not it's not going to pan out. And the people who do make progress towards these things, like James Maynard, is a great example here of like young creative mathematician who, like, pushes in the direction of things like the twin prime conjecture rather than hitting that head on. Just see all the interesting questions that are hard for similar reasons, but become more tractable and let themselves really engage with those. Um, so I think people should get in that habit. I think the popularization of physics should encourage that habit through things like the physics of simple everyday phenomena because it can get quite deep and. Yeah, I think, you know, I've heard a lot of the interest that people send me messages asking to explain Weinstein's thing or I think to explain Wolfram's thing, one, I don't understand them, but more importantly, it's too big a bite and you shouldn't be interested in those. Right. The giant sort of ball of interesting ideas. There's probably a million of interesting ideas in there that individually could be explored effectively. And to be clear, you should be interested in fundamental questions. I think that's a good habit to ask what the fundamentals of things are, but I think it takes a lot of steps to certainly you shouldn't be trying to ask unless you actually understand quantum field theory and you actually understand general relativity. That's the cool thing about your videos. People haven't done mathematics. Like if you really give a time watching a couple of times and like try to try to reason about it, you can actually understand the concept that's being explained. And it's not a coincidence that the things I'm describing aren't like the most up to date progress on the Riemann Hypothesis cousins or like there's context in which the analogue of the human hypothesis has been solved and more discrete feeling finite settings that are more well behaved. I'm not describing that because it just takes a ton to get there. And instead, I think it'll be like productive to have an actual understanding of something that can you can pack into twenty minutes. I think that's beautifully put. Ultimately, that's where like the most satisfying thing when you really understand. Yeah, really understand build the habit of feeling what it's like to actually come to resolution. Yeah, yeah. As opposed to which it can also be enjoyable, but just being in awe of the fact that you don't understand anything. Yeah, but like, I don't know, maybe people get entertainment out of that, but it's not as fulfilling as understanding you won't grow. Yeah. And but also just the fulfilling and it really does feel good when you first don't understand something and then you do. That's a beautiful feeling. Let me ask you one last last time it got awkward and weird about a fear of mortality, which you made fun of me of. But let me ask you on the the other absurd question is, what do you think is the meaning of our life, of meaning of life? I'm sorry if I made fun of you about which. No, you didn't. I'm just joking. It is great. I don't think life has a meaning. I think like meaning. I don't understand the question. I think meaning is something that's ascribed to stuff that's created with purpose. There's a meaning to like this water bottle label and that someone created it with a purpose of conveying meaning. And there was like one consciousness that wanted to get its ideas into another consciousness. Most things don't have that property. It's a little bit like if I asked you, like, what is the height? All right, so it's all relative. You'd be like the height of what you can't ask, what is the height without an object? You can't ask what is the meaning of life without, like, an intent for consciousness putting it? Well, yeah, I guess I'm revealing I'm not very religious. But, you know, the mathematics of everything seems kind of beautiful. It seems like it seems like there's some kind of structure. Relative to which, I mean, you could calculate the height well, but what I'm saying is I don't understand the question, what is the meaning of life in that I think people might be asking something very real. I don't understand what they're asking. Are they asking like, why does life exist? Like, how did it come about? What are the natural laws? Are they asking as I'm making decisions day by day for what should I do? What is the guiding light that inspires? Like what should I do? I think that's what people are kind of asking. But also like why the thing that gives you joy about education, about mathematics, what the hell is that like? What interactions with other people, interactions with like minded people, I think is the meaning of, in that sense, bringing others joy. Essentially, like in something you've created, it connects with others somehow and the same and the vice versa. But I think that that is what when we use the word meaning to mean, like you sort of filled with a sense of happiness and energy to create more things. Like I have so much meaning taken from this. Like that. Yeah. That's what fuels fuels my pump at least. So a life alone on a desert island be kind of meaningless if you want to be alone together with someone. I think we're all alone together. I think there's no better way to end it. You've been first time we talked as amazing. Again, it's a huge honor that you make time for me. I appreciate talking with you. Thanks for an awesome.

And now let me leave you some words from Richard Feynman. I have a friend who's an artist and is sometimes taking a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say, look how beautiful it is. And I'll agree. Then he says, I, as an artist can see how beautiful this is. But you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing. And I think he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me, too, I believe, although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is, I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I can imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean, it's not just beauty at this dimension, that one centimeter. There's also beauty in smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes, the fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting. It means that insects can see the color. It adds a question. Does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the all of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
